  Importance: Preferential delivery of docetaxel to tumors by prostate-specificmembrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted nanoparticles is clinically effective, and theselective reduction of PSMA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) aftertreatment has implications for patient selection and disease monitoring.Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of BIND-014, a PSMA-directeddocetaxel-containing nanoparticle, in patients with metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter open-label, phase 2 clinicaltrial of 42 chemotherapy-naive patients with progressing mCRPC after treatmentwith abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide was conducted from June 24, 2013, toJune 10, 2016.Intervention: Treatment with BIND-014 at a dosage of 60 mg/m2 was givenintravenously on day 1 of 21-day cycles in combination with prednisone untildisease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was radiographicprogression-free survival according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2recommendations and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.Secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50%reduction from baseline) and changes in CTC number (from ≥5 to <5 cells per 7.5mL of blood) (CellSearch). Changes in CTC number based on PSMA expression levelson CTCs were also evaluated (Epic Sciences).Results: Among the 42 patients (81% white), the median age was 66 (range, 50-85)years, and median number of doses received was 6 (range, 1-21). A PSA responsewas observed in 12 of 40 patients (30%; 95% CI, 18%-45%), measurable diseaseresponse in 6 of 19 (32% [95% CI, 15%-54%]), and CTC conversions in 13 of 26(50%; 95% CI, 32%-68%). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 9.9(95% CI, 7.1-12.6) months. With use of the Epic Sciences non-EPCAM-based CTCdetection platform, CTCs were detected in 16 of 18 patients (89%); 11 of 18 (61%)had CTCs with PSMA expression above the analytical threshold level (PSMApositive) at baseline (range, 0.4-72.4 CTCs/mL). After treatment, PSMA-positiveCTCs were preferentially reduced. Treatment-related adverse events included grade1 or 2 fatigue (29 of 42 patients [69%]), nausea (23 [55%]), neuropathy (14[33%]), and neutropenic fever (1 [2%]).Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that treatment with BIND-014 isactive and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Antitumoractivity may be related to PSMA expression levels on CTCs, which suggests thatpatients who are likely to benefit from this treatment can be identified beforetreatment is initiated.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01812746.

  Loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) occurs early in >95% of clear cellrenal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Nearly ubiquitous 3p loss in ccRCC suggestshaploinsufficiency for 3p tumor suppressors as early drivers of tumorigenesis. Wepreviously reported methyltransferase SETD2, which trimethylates H3 histones onlysine 36 (H3K36me3) and is located in the 3p deletion, to also trimethylatemicrotubules on lysine 40 (αTubK40me3) during mitosis, with αTubK40me3 requiredfor genomic stability. We now show that monoallelic, Setd2-deficient cellsretaining H3K36me3, but not αTubK40me3, exhibit a dramatic increase in mitoticdefects and micronuclei count, with increased viability compared with biallelicloss. In SETD2-inactivated human kidney cells, rescue with a pathogenic SETD2mutant deficient for microtubule (αTubK40me3), but not histone (H3K36me3)methylation, replicated this phenotype. Genomic instability (micronuclei) wasalso a hallmark of patient-derived cells from ccRCC. These data show that theSETD2 tumor suppressor displays a haploinsufficiency phenotype disproportionatelyimpacting microtubule methylation and serves as an early driver of genomicinstability.Significance: Loss of a single allele of a chromatin modifier plays arole in promoting oncogenesis, underscoring the growing relevance of tumorsuppressor haploinsufficiency in tumorigenesis.

  Addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) has been acknowledged as anessential objective for the promotion of both population health and healthequity. Extant literature has identified seven potential areas of investment toaddress SDoH: investments in sexual and reproductive health and family planning,early learning and child care, education, universal health care, as well asinvestments to reduce child poverty, ensure sustainable economic development, andcontrol health hazards. The aim of this paper is to produce a 'report card' onCanada's success in reducing socioeconomic and health inequities pertaining tothese seven policy domains, and to assess how Canadian trends compare to those inthe United Kingdom (UK), a country with a similar health and welfare system.Summarising evidence from published studies and national statistics, we foundthat Canada's best successes were in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in earlylearning and child care and reproductive health-specifically in improving equityin maternal employment and infant mortality. Comparative data suggest thatCanada's outcomes in the latter areas were like those in the UK. In contrast,Canada's least promising equity outcomes were in relation to health hazardcontrol (specifically, tobacco) and child poverty. Though Canada and the UKobserved similar inequities in smoking, Canada's slow upward trend in childpoverty prevalence is distinct from the UK's small but steady reduction of childpoverty. This divergence from the UK's trends indicates that alternativeinvestment types and levels may be needed in Canada to achieve similar outcomesto those in the UK.

  Human endogenous retroviruses (hERVs) are remnants of exogenous retroviruses thathave integrated into the genome throughout evolution. We developed acomputational workflow, hervQuant, which identified more than 3,000transcriptionally active hERVs within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancerRNA-Seq database. hERV expression was associated with clinical prognosis inseveral tumor types, most significantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).We explored two mechanisms by which hERV expression may influence the tumorimmune microenvironment in ccRCC: (i) RIG-I-like signaling and (ii) retroviralantigen activation of adaptive immunity. We demonstrated the ability of hERVsignatures associated with these immune mechanisms to predict patient survival inccRCC, independent of clinical staging and molecular subtyping. We identifiedpotential tumor-specific hERV epitopes with evidence of translational activitythrough the use of a ccRCC ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) dataset, validated theirability to bind HLA in vitro, and identified the presence of MHCtetramer-positive T cells against predicted epitopes. hERV sequences identifiedthrough this screening approach were significantly more highly expressed in ccRCCtumors responsive to treatment with programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)inhibition. hervQuant provides insights into the role of hERVs within the tumorimmune microenvironment, as well as evidence that hERV expression could serve asa biomarker for patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy.
