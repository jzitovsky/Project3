The nextflow depends on a custom  docker image (see nextflow.config file) from a provided Dockerfile which must be named “strex”. I built the image with the command “docker build -t strex .” Once the image is built, the nextflow pipeline, main.nf, can be run with the command “”nextflow main.nf”. The pipeline should create five data sets in your current directory (assuming you removed the data sets before running main.nf). The app.R script will read three of the data sets, and use them to create the shiny app.
