The nextflow depends on a custom  docker image (see nextflow.config file) from a provided Dockerfile which must be named “strex”. I built the image with the command “docker build -t strex .” Once the image is built, the nextflow pipeline, main.nf, can be run with the command “”nextflow main.nf”. The pipeline should create three data sets in your current directory. The app.R script should read these data sets, and use them to create the shiny app. I have not actually tested the shiny app on the VCL, though it worked when I used it on RStudio and I believe it should work correctly on the VCL as well. 
There are a two things I would like to point out to whomever is grading my assignment, in case he/she is not aware already. First, Dr. Biggs said that he did not care about accuracy with respect to collaborators and words. He solely cares about a student's ability to make a shiny app and use Nextflow, not on their correctness in collaborators and word frequencies. Thus, please do not mark points off if my top 10 collaborators are not correct, etc. Second, Dr. Biggs said that he did not care whether the top words found for each collaborator can properly differentiate collaborators or answer any meaningful quesitons. Thus, please do not mark points off if you feel the words I found for each collaborator aren't useful for differentiation or answering questions regarding which collaborator conducts which kind of research.
