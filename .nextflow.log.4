  Importance: Preferential delivery of docetaxel to tumors by prostate-specificmembrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted nanoparticles is clinically effective, and theselective reduction of PSMA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) aftertreatment has implications for patient selection and disease monitoring.Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of BIND-014, a PSMA-directeddocetaxel-containing nanoparticle, in patients with metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter open-label, phase 2 clinicaltrial of 42 chemotherapy-naive patients with progressing mCRPC after treatmentwith abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide was conducted from June 24, 2013, toJune 10, 2016.Intervention: Treatment with BIND-014 at a dosage of 60 mg/m2 was givenintravenously on day 1 of 21-day cycles in combination with prednisone untildisease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was radiographicprogression-free survival according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2recommendations and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.Secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50%reduction from baseline) and changes in CTC number (from ≥5 to <5 cells per 7.5mL of blood) (CellSearch). Changes in CTC number based on PSMA expression levelson CTCs were also evaluated (Epic Sciences).Results: Among the 42 patients (81% white), the median age was 66 (range, 50-85)years, and median number of doses received was 6 (range, 1-21). A PSA responsewas observed in 12 of 40 patients (30%; 95% CI, 18%-45%), measurable diseaseresponse in 6 of 19 (32% [95% CI, 15%-54%]), and CTC conversions in 13 of 26(50%; 95% CI, 32%-68%). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 9.9(95% CI, 7.1-12.6) months. With use of the Epic Sciences non-EPCAM-based CTCdetection platform, CTCs were detected in 16 of 18 patients (89%); 11 of 18 (61%)had CTCs with PSMA expression above the analytical threshold level (PSMApositive) at baseline (range, 0.4-72.4 CTCs/mL). After treatment, PSMA-positiveCTCs were preferentially reduced. Treatment-related adverse events included grade1 or 2 fatigue (29 of 42 patients [69%]), nausea (23 [55%]), neuropathy (14[33%]), and neutropenic fever (1 [2%]).Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that treatment with BIND-014 isactive and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Antitumoractivity may be related to PSMA expression levels on CTCs, which suggests thatpatients who are likely to benefit from this treatment can be identified beforetreatment is initiated.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01812746.
