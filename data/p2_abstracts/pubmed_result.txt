Macrophages hold great potential in cancer drug delivery because they can sense
chemotactic cues and home to tumors with high efficiency. However, it remains a
challenge to load large amounts of therapeutics into macrophages without
compromising cell functions. This study reports a silica-based drug nanocapsule
approach to solve this issue. The nanocapsule consists of a drug-silica complex
filling and a solid silica sheath, and it is designed to minimally release drug
molecules in the early hours of cell entry. While taken up by macrophages at high
rates, the nanocapsules minimally affect cell migration in the first 6-12 h,
buying time for macrophages to home to tumors and release drugs in situ. In
particular, it is shown that doxorubicin (Dox) as a representative drug can be
loaded into macrophages up to 16.6 pg per cell using this approach. When tested
in a U87MG xenograft model, intravenously (i.v.) injected Dox-laden macrophages
show comparable tumor accumulation as untreated macrophages. Therapy leads to
efficient tumor growth suppression, while causing little systematic toxicity.
This study suggests a new cell platform for selective drug delivery, which can be
readily extended to the treatment of other types of diseases.

PURPOSE: Parents with cancer have unique and often under-recognized psychological
distress about the impact of their illness on their children. Relatively little
is known about how parenting concerns may differ among patients by cancer stage.
METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of 203 adults with cancer who had
children < 18 years old from two geographically distinct areas. We used an
analysis of covariance to estimate the mean differences in PCQ, depression
symptom severity and anxiety symptom severity (Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale, HADS) scores between participants with metastatic and non-metastatic
disease, and Pearson's correlation coefficients to assess associations between
HADS and PCQ scores by cancer stage.
RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of participants (n = 146) had metastatic solid tumor
cancer. In adjusted analyses, mean PCQ scores did not significantly differ
between parents with metastatic and non-metastatic disease (2.0 vs. 2.2,
p = 0.06). Differences in mean PCQ scores were driven by a single question
concerning the impact of death on children (2.3 vs. 2.9, p = 0.004). Mean HADS
scores did not significantly differ between groups, although PCQ scores explained
a greater amount of variance in HADS scores for the metastatic group as compared 
to the non-metastatic group.
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of concerns about death, intensity of parenting
concerns, as measured by the PCQ, was similar between parents with metastatic and
non-metastatic cancer. However, parenting concerns may be more strongly linked to
overall psychological distress in patients with metastatic disease. Further
research is needed to clarify how parenting concerns uniquely relate to advanced 
stage illness.

PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the recommended
dose of the vascular disrupting agent, BNC105P, in combination with gemcitabine
and carboplatin in patients with ovarian cancer in first or second relapse with a
minimum 4 month progression-free interval after last platinum.
METHODS: Patients received carboplatin AUC4 on day 1 in combination with
escalating doses of 800 or 1000 mg/m2 gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 and escalating 
doses of 12 or 16 mg/m2 BNC105P on days 2 and 9 every 21 days for a maximum for
six cycles. Maintenance treatment with 16 mg/m2 BNC105P treatment continued for a
maximum of six additional cycles. Patients were followed for safety and
anti-tumor activity.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. Adverse events were most
commonly of hematological origin. Dose-limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia and 
neutropenia) occurred in two patients at the dose level of 800 mg/m2 gemcitabine,
carboplatin AUC4 and 16 mg/m2 BNC105P. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed 
at a dose level of gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, carboplatin AUC4 and BNC105P 12 mg/m2.
BNC105P as a single agent was well tolerated at a dose of 16 mg/m2 in maintenance
treatment. Ten patients (67%) achieved a complete or partial response according
to CA125 and/or RECIST response criteria, four of 13 (31%) responded by RECIST
alone. The median progression-free survival was 5.9 months.
CONCLUSIONS: We have established that BNC105P 12 mg/m2 with gemcitabine
1000 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC4 is the recommended dose level and has an
acceptable toxicity profile. Further exploration of BNC105P in the ovarian cancer
setting is planned.

PURPOSE: Exposure to the polyphenolic plant lignan secoisolariciresinol
diglucoside (SDG) and its metabolite enterolactone (ENL) has been associated with
reduced breast cancer progression, particularly for estrogen receptor alpha
(ERα)-negative disease, and decreased preclinical mammary tumor growth. However, 
while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures of
progression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset of
ERα-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain
unclear.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were fed a control diet (control, 10% kcal from fat) or
control diet + SDG (SDG, 100 mg/kg diet) for 8 weeks, then orthotopically
injected with syngeneic E0771 mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growth
was monitored for 3 weeks. The role of reduced NF-κB signaling in SDG's
anti-tumor effects was explored in vitro via treatment with the bioactive SDG
metabolite ENL. In addition to the murine E0771 cells, the in vitro studies
utilized MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, two human cell lines which model the
triple-negative and luminal A breast cancer subtypes, respectively.
RESULTS: SDG supplementation in the mice significantly reduced tumor volume and
expression of phospho-p65 and NF-κB target genes (P < 0.05). Markers of
macrophage infiltration were decreased in the distal-to-tumor mammary fat pad of 
mice supplemented with SDG relative to control mice (P < 0.05). In vitro, ENL
treatment inhibited viability, survival, and NF-κB activity and target gene
expression in E0771, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells (P < 0.05). Overexpression of
Rela attenuated ENL's inhibition of E0771 cell viability and survival.
CONCLUSIONS: SDG reduces tumor growth in the E0771 model of TNBC, likely via a
mechanism involving inhibition of NF-κB activity. SDG could serve as a practical 
and effective adjuvant treatment to reduce recurrence, but greater understanding 
of its effects is needed to inform the development of more targeted
recommendations for its use.

Parents have varied HPV vaccine communication needs, which presents a challenge
for healthcare providers. To improve communication resources for providers, we
sought to characterize HPV vaccination messages available in existing educational
materials. In fall 2016, we searched PubMed, educational material clearinghouses,
and Google for English language HPV vaccination messages. We extracted messages
that a provider might use when raising the topic of HPV vaccination, answering
common questions, and motivating vaccination. Two reviewers independently coded
each message. The search identified 267 unique messages about HPV vaccination.
Messages generally were long (mean no. of words = 44, standard deviation
[SD] = 33) and required a high level of education to read (mean reading grade
level = 10, SD = 3). Only 32% of messages were shorter than 25 words, and 12% had
a readability at or below grade 6. Most frequent were messages to address common 
parent questions or concerns (62%); the most common topics were diseases
prevented by HPV vaccine (18%) and safety and side effects (16%). Many messages
included information about cancer prevention (26%) and same-day vaccination
(13%). Few messages (6%) used a presumptive style to recommend HPV vaccination.
In conclusion, available messages about HPV vaccination were markedly varied. We 
identified few messages that were both brief (to facilitate providers memorizing 
them) and accessible (to facilitate parents understanding them). Future research 
should identify which messages lead to HPV vaccine uptake.

Objectives: Cervical cancer can often be cured by surgery alone, if diagnosed and
treated early. However, of the cancer patients who live in the world's poorest
countries less that 5% have access to safe, effective and timely cancer surgery. 
We designed a novel, competency-based curriculum to rapidly build surgical
capacity for the treatment of cervical cancer. Here we report experiences and
early outcomes of its implementation in Malawi.
Methods: Curriculum implementation consisted of preoperative evaluation of
patients and surgical video review, discussion of surgical instruments and suture
material, deconstruction of the surgical procedure into critical subcomponents
including trainees walking through the steps of the procedure with the master
trainers, high-volume surgical repetition over a short time interval,
intra-operative mentoring, post-operative case review, and mental narration. This
was preceded by self-directed learning and followed by clinical mentorship
through electronic communication and quarterly on-site visits.
Results: Between June 2015-June 2017, 28 patients underwent radical abdominal
hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The first 8 surgeries were
performed over 5 days. After the 7th case the trainee could perform the procedure
alone. During and between quarterly mentoring-visits the trainee independently
performed the procedure on 20 additional patients. Major surgical complications
were rare.
Conclusions: Life-saving surgical treatment for cervical cancer is now available 
for the first time, as a routine clinical service, in Central/Northern, Malawi.

Background: To our knowledge, no published studies utilizing a randomized
controlled design have examined the efficacy of patient navigation for improving 
clinical trial enrollment.
Methods: This patient navigation and clinical trial participation study is a
randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a patient navigator on
enrollment into therapeutic cancer clinical trials. Participants are randomly
assigned to high intensity, patient navigator-delivered patient educational
materials (PEM) and needs assessment vs. low intensity patient navigation
(patient navigator-delivered patient educational materials [PEM] alone).
Discussion: Effective enrollment strategies may include utilization of patient
navigators as away to meet individual needs, barriers, and concerns of
participants enrolled in clinical trials.

Purpose: To conduct an exploratory study to identify mechanisms that
differentiate Luminal A (BT474 and MCF-7) and triple-negative (MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468) breast cancer (BCa) cell lines to potentially provide novel
therapeutic targets based on differences in energy utilization.
Methods: Cells were cultured in media containing either [U-13C]-glucose or
[U-13C]-glutamine for 48 hours. Conditioned media and cellular extracts were
analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
Results: MCF-7 cells consumed the most glucose, producing the most lactate,
demonstrating the greatest Warburg effect-associated energy utilization. BT474
cells had the highest tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activity. The majority of
energy utilization patterns in MCF-7 cells were more similar to MDA-MB-468 cells,
while the patterns for BT474 cells were more similar to MDA-MB-231 cells.
Compared to the Luminal A cell lines, TNBC cell lines consumed more glutamine and
less glucose. BT474 and MDA-MB-468 cells produced high amounts of 13C-glycine
from media [U-13C]-glucose which was integrated into glutathione, indicating de
novo synthesis.
Conclusions: Stable isotopic resolved metabolomics using 13C substrates provided 
mechanistic information about energy utilization that was difficult to interpret 
using 1H data alone. Overall, cell lines that have different hormone receptor
status have different energy utilization requirements, even if they are
classified by the same clinical BCa subtype; and these differences offer clues
about optimizing treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: The indication of surgical resection in esophageal cancer is often
conditioned by patient's age. We aimed to assess the trends in utilization of
surgical treatment for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in the United States,
stratified by age groups.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Institute's
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program registry for the period
2004-2014. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with EAC were eligible for
inclusion. The yearly incidence of esophagectomy, stratified by age groups
(18-49, 50-70, and >70 years old), was calculated using Poisson regression.
Weighted log-binomial regression was used to compare the proportion of patients
undergoing esophagectomy, within each age group. Inverse probability of treatment
weights were used to account for potential confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 21,301 patients were included. During the study period, the
rate of esophagectomy decreased from 34.1% to 28.2% (P = .40) in patients between
18 and 49 years old, from 38.6% to 33.3% (P = .06) in patients between 50 and 70 
years old, and from 21.4% to 16.9% (P = .04) in patients older than 70 years.
After accounting for patient and cancer characteristics, patients older than 70
years were 50% less likely to undergo esophagectomy compared with both patients
between 18 and 49 years old (risk ratio [RR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]
0.45-0.57, P < .0001) and patients between 50 and 70 years old (RR 0.53, 95% CI
0.50-0.56, P < .0001).
CONCLUSION: Surgical resection is scarcely used in patients older than 70 years
in the United States. Further investigation of surgical outcomes in elderly
patients is warranted to determine if surgical treatment is underutilized in a
large proportion of EAC patients.

BACKGROUND: Traditionally, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of
the pancreas with "high risk stigmata" (HRS) or "worrisome features" (WF) are
referred for resection. We aim to assess if IPMN location is predictive of
harboring either high grade dysplasia (HGD) or invasive cancer (IC).
METHODS: Patients undergoing resection for IPMN from seven institutions between
2000 and 2015 (n = 275) were analyzed. HRS and WF were defined by the 2012
Fukuoka international consensus guidelines.
RESULTS: 168 (61%) patients had head/uncinate cysts, while 107 (39%) had
neck/body/tail cysts. No differences were noted between groups with regard to
age, duct type, cyst size, or presence of at least one WF. Patients with cysts in
the head/uncinate were more often male (55% vs. 40%), had at least one HRS (24%
vs. 11%), and more often harbored HGD or IC(49% vs. 27%)[all p < 0.05]. On
multivariate analysis, only cyst location in the head/uncinate remained
associated with presence of HGD or IC(odds ratio 4.76, p = 0.02).
DISCUSSION: Cyst location is predictive of HGD or IC in patients with IPMNs.
Head/uncinated cysts are more likely to harbor malignancy compared to those of
the neck/body/tail. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings,
however, cyst location should be considered part of the decision making process
for surveillance vs. resection for IPMNs.

OBJECTIVE: To examine intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) use according to non-muscle
invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patient disease risk, and the contributions of
multi-level factors to variation in proficient use among patients with
low-intermediate disease.
METHODS: This study included 988 patients diagnosed with NMIBC in an integrated
health system in Northern California from 2015-2017. We calculated IVC receipt by
disease risk, and among patients with low-intermediate risk disease, assessed the
relationship between multi-level factors and IVC receipt using a logistic
regression model with random intercepts for provider and service area, and
patient-, provider-, and service area-level fixed effects. We further assessed
the association of provider- and service area-level factors with IVC use by
examining intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs).
RESULTS: Similar proportions of low-intermediate (36%) and high-risk (34%)
patients received IVC. In the multivariate analysis including low-intermediate
risk patients, service area volume was strongly and statistically significantly
associated with IVC use (aOR, high- v. low-volume: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.58).
Provider- and service area-level ICCs were large, (38%, p=0.0009 and 39% p=0.03, 
respectively) indicating that much of the variance in IVC use was explained by
factors at these levels.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight opportunities to improve proficient use of
IVC. Future research should assess provider- and practice-level barriers to IVC
use among low-intermediate risk patients.

PURPOSE:: Because of the escalating cost of cancer care coupled with high
insurance deductibles, premiums, and uninsured populations, patients with cancer 
are affected by treatment-related financial harm, known as financial toxicity.
The purpose of this study was to describe individuals reporting financial
toxicity and to identify rates of and reasons for affordability-related treatment
noncompliance.
METHODS:: From May 2010 to November 2015, adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with
cancer were identified from a Health Registry/Cancer Survivorship Cohort.
Financial toxicity was defined as agreement with the phrase "You have to pay for 
more medical care than you can afford" from the Patient Satisfaction
Questionnaire-18. Logistic regression and Fisher exact tests were used to compare
groups.
RESULTS:: Of 1,988 participants, 524 (26%) reported financial toxicity. Patients 
reporting financial toxicity were more likely age 65 years or younger, female,
nonwhite, non-English speaking, not married, less educated, and to have received 
a diagnosis more recently (all P < .001). Participants with financial toxicity
were more likely to report noncompliance with medication, owing to inability to
afford prescription drugs (relative risk [RR], 3.55; 95% CI, 2.53 to 4.98), and
reported forgoing mental health care (RR, 3.89; 95% CI, 2.04 to 7.45), doctor's
visits (RR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.97 to 4.51), and medical tests (RR, 2.54; 95% CI,
1.49 to 4.34). The most endorsed reasons for delayed care were not having
insurance coverage and being unable to afford household expenses.
CONCLUSION:: More than 25% of adults with cancer reported financial toxicity that
was associated with an increased risk for medical noncompliance. Financial
toxicity remains a major issue in cancer care, and efforts are needed to ensure
patients experiencing high levels of financial toxicity are able to access
recommended care.

OBJECTIVE: To describe associations of functional, psychosocial, medical, and
socio-demographic factors with performance on a cognitive screening test in
chemotherapy naïve patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: Women with breast cancer were recruited between 2009 and 2018. The
Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration Test (BOMC) was administered prior to
chemotherapy. Associations between baseline BOMC and functional (Karnofsky
Self-Reported Performance Rating Scale (KPS), Time Up and Go Test (TUG), Medical 
Outcomes Study (MOS) Physical Function, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
(IADL)), psychosocial (Mental Health Inventory-13, MOS Social Activity Limitation
and Social Support Survey), medical, and socio-demographic variables were
assessed using linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: In a sample of 331 women with breast cancer, the mean age was 65.2 years
and 68.6% were 65 and older. Mean BOMC score was 3.60 on a scale from 0 (best) to
28 (worst). After controlling for demographic factors, worse BOMC screening test 
results were associated with KPS < 80 (p=0.01), IADL< 14 (p=0.02), TUG ≥ 14
seconds (p=0.001), worse MOS Physical Function (p=0.0006), depressive symptoms
(p=0.04), and social activity limitations (p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: In a sample of women with breast cancer, pre-treatment cognitive
screening scores did not reveal profound cognitive impairment. BOMC screening
scores were associated with multiple measures of physical function, but further
research is needed to determine a clinically meaningful cut point in the BOMC for
screening of cancer-related cognitive impairment.

To describe autoantibodies (Abs) against tripartite motif-containing (TRIM)
protein 9 and 67 in two patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration
(PCD) associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Abs were characterized using
immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, cultures of murine cortical, and
hippocampal neurons, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, knockout mice for
Trim9 and 67, and cell-based assay. Control samples included sera from 63
patients with small cell lung cancer without any paraneoplastic neurological
syndrome, 36 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and PNS, CSF from 100 patients
with autoimmune encephalitis, and CSF from 165 patients with neurodegenerative
diseases. We found Abs targeting TRIM9 and TRIM67 at high concentration in the
serum and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a 78-year-old woman and a 65-year-old 
man. Both developed subacute severe cerebellar ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance
imaging found no abnormality and no cerebellar atrophy. Both had CSF inflammation
with mild pleiocytosis and a few oligoclonal bands. We identified a pulmonary
adenocarcinoma, confirming the paraneoplastic neurological syndrome in both
patients. They received immunomodulatory and cancer treatments without
improvement of cerebellar ataxia, even though both were in remission of their
cancer (for more than 10 years in one patient). Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs
were specific to these two patients. All control serum and CSF samples tested
were negative for anti-TRIM9 and 67. Anti-TRIM9 and anti-TRIM67 Abs appeared to
be specific biomarkers of PCD and should be added to the panel of antigens tested
when this is suspected.

BACKGROUND: Although metastasis is ultimately responsible for about 90% of breast
cancer mortality, the vast majority of breast-cancer-related deaths are due to
progressive recurrences from non-metastatic disease. Current adjuvant therapies
are unable to prevent progressive recurrences for a significant fraction of
patients with breast cancer. Autologous tumor cell vaccines (ATCVs) are a safe
and potentially useful strategy to prevent breast cancer recurrence, in a
personalized and patient-specific manner, following standard-of-care tumor
resection. Given the high intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity in breast
cancer, it is important to understand which factors influence the immunogenicity 
of breast tumor cells in order to maximize ATCV effectiveness.
METHODS: The relative immunogenicity of two murine breast carcinomas, 4T1 and
EMT6, were compared in a prophylactic vaccination-tumor challenge model.
Differences in cell surface expression of antigen-presentation-related and
costimulatory molecules were compared along with immunosuppressive cytokine
production. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to modulate tumor-derived cytokine
secretion. The impacts of cytokine deletion on splenomegaly, myeloid-derived
suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and ATCV immunogenicity were assessed.
RESULTS: Mice vaccinated with an EMT6 vaccine exhibited significantly greater
protective immunity than mice vaccinated with a 4T1 vaccine. Hybrid vaccination
studies revealed that the 4T1 vaccination induced both local and systemic immune 
impairments. Although there were significant differences between EMT6 and 4T1 in 
the expression of costimulatory molecules, major disparities in the secretion of 
immunosuppressive cytokines likely accounts for differences in immunogenicity
between the cell lines. Ablation of one cytokine in particular,
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), reversed MDSC accumulation and
splenomegaly in the 4T1 model. Furthermore, G-CSF inhibition enhanced the
immunogenicity of a 4T1-based vaccine to the extent that all vaccinated mice
developed complete protective immunity.
CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer cells that express high levels of G-CSF have the
potential to diminish or abrogate the efficacy of breast cancer ATCVs.
Fortunately, this study demonstrates that genetic ablation of immunosuppressive
cytokines, such as G-CSF, can enhance the immunogenicity of breast cancer
cell-based vaccines. Strategies that combine inhibition of immunosuppressive
factors with immune stimulatory co-formulations already under development may
help ATCVs reach their full potential.

In 2017, due to a fluid shortage secondary to Hurricane Maria's devastation of
Puerto Rico, hospitals and health-systems began to substitute rolapitant for
fosaprepitant as part of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prevention and 
treatment strategies. However, despite advantageous pharmacologic and formulation
(e.g. long half-life, quicker time to onset, and lack of first-pass hepatic
metabolism) profiles, there seems to be significant risk of infusion-related
hypersensitivity reactions associated with the administration of intravenous
rolapitant. In January 2018, the U.S. FDA issued a Health Care Provider Letter
stating that anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, and other serious hypersensitivity 
reactions have been reported in the postmarketing setting. Importantly, these
reactions were observed at a higher rate than initially reported in the phase 1
bioequivalence study that led to FDA approval of intravenous rolapitant (2.8%),
with many resulting in hospitalizations. At our institution, rolapitant-induced
infusion-related reactions also occurred in more patients than expected (8.7%).
Described herein are six cases of infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions
with intravenous rolapitant at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital. Due to the
quick onset of the infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions with intravenous
rolapitant, interpatient differences in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics are 
unlikely to be the cause. An objective assessment utilizing the Naranjo Causality
Scale rates these infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions as definite adverse
drug reactions.

As an important part of modern health care, medical imaging data, which can be
regarded as densely sampled functional data, have been widely used for diagnosis,
screening, treatment, and prognosis, such as finding breast cancer through
mammograms. The aim of this paper is to propose a functional linear regression
model for using functional (or imaging) predictors to predict clinical outcomes
(e.g., disease status), while addressing missing clinical outcomes. We introduce 
an exponential tilting semiparametric model to account for the nonignorable
missing data mechanism. We develop a set of estimating equations and its
associated computational methods for both parameter estimation and the selection 
of the tuning parameters. We also propose a bootstrap resampling procedure for
carrying out statistical inference. Under some regularity conditions, we
systematically establish the asymptotic properties (e.g., consistency and
convergence rate) of the estimates calculated from the proposed estimating
equations. Simulation studies and a real data analysis are used to illustrate the
finite sample performance of the proposed methods.

Lack of information on the clinical utility of preemptive DPYD screening prior to
fluoropyrimidine treatment is a major barrier preventing its utilization in
clinical practice. This study aimed to define the association between DPYD
variants and fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity management costs. A cost analysis 
was conducted on the toxicities experienced by 550 colorectal cancer patients
treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Genotyping for DPYD*2A,
DPYD*13, DPYDc.2846A>T, DPYD-HapB3, and UGT1A1*28 was done retrospectively, and
did not affect patients' treatments. Carriers of at least one DPYD variant
experienced higher toxicity management costs (2,972€, 95%CI 2,456-3,505) than
noncarriers (825€, 95%CI 785-864) (P<0.0001) and had a higher risk for toxicity
requiring hospitalization (OR=4.14, 95%CI 1.87-9.14). In patients receiving
fluoropyrimidine/irinotecan, the incremental cost between DPYD variant and
UGT1A1*28/*28 carriers and noncarriers was 2,975€. This study suggests that the
toxicity management costs during fluoropyrimidine-based therapy are associated
with DPYD and UGT1A1*28 variants, and supports the utility of genotyping. This

General Relative Rate Models for the Analysis of Case-Cohort Designs.

A standard approach to analysis of case-cohort data involves fitting log-linear
models. We describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broad 
class of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidence
intervals. We focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembled 
and events ascertained, but additional information needs to be collected on
explanatory variables. The additional information is ascertained just for
individuals who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohort
members enumerated at study entry. One appeal of such a case-cohort design is
that this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of several
outcomes. The ability to fit general relative rate models to case cohort data may
allow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-response
analyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive and
others multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due to
interaction. We address model fitting for simple random sampling designs as well 
as stratified designs. Data on lung cancer among radon exposed men are used to
illustrate these methods.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a liquid biopsy marker that can carry signatures (i.e., 
mutations) associated with certain pathological conditions. Therefore, the
extraction of cfDNA from a variety of clinical samples can be an effective and
minimally invasive source of markers for disease detection and subsequent
management. In the oncological diseases, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a cfDNA
sub-class, can carry clinically actionable mutations and coupled with next
generation sequencing or other mutation detection methods provide a venue for
effective in vitro diagnostics. However, cfDNA mutational analyses require high
quality inputs. This necessitates extraction platforms that provide high recovery
over the entire ctDNA size range (50 → 150 bp) with minimal interferences (i.e., 
co-extraction of genomic DNA), and high reproducibility with a simple workflow.
Herein, we present a novel microfluidic solid-phase extraction device (μSPE)
consisting of a plastic chip that is activated with UV/O3 to generate
surface-confined carboxylic acid functionalities for the μSPE of cfDNA. The μSPE 
uses an immobilization buffer (IB) consisting of polyethylene glycol and salts
that induce cfDNA condensation onto the activated plastic microfluidic surface.
The μSPE consists of an array of micropillars to increase extraction bed load
(scalable to loads >700 ng of cfDNA) and can be produced at low-cost using
replication-based techniques. The entire μSPE can be fabricated in a single
molding step negating the need for adding additional extraction supports to the
device simplifying production and keeping device and assay cost low. The μSPE
allowed for recoveries >90% of model cfDNA fragments across a range of sizes
(100-700 bp) and even the ability to extract efficiently short cfDNA fragments
(50 bp, >70%). In addition, the composition of the IB allowed for reducing the
interference of co-extracted genomic DNA. We demonstrated the clinical utility of
the μSPE by quantifying the levels of cfDNA in healthy donors and patients with
non-small-cell lung and colorectal cancers. μSPE extracted cfDNA from plasma
samples was also subjected to a ligase detection reaction (LDR) for determining
the presence of mutations in the KRAS gene for colorectal and non-small cell lung
cancer patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the implications of a cancer diagnosis on medication
adherence for pre-existing comorbid conditions, we explored statin adherence
patterns prior to and following a new diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or
prostate cancer among a multi-ethnic cohort.
METHODS: We identified adults enrolled at Kaiser Permanente Northern California
who were prevalent statin medication users, newly diagnosed with breast,
colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2012. Statin adherence was
measured using the proportion of days covered (PDC) during the 2-year pre-cancer 
diagnosis and the 2-year post-cancer diagnosis. Adherence patterns were assessed 
using generalized estimating equations, for all cancers combined and stratified
by cancer type and race/ethnicity, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and tumor 
characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 10,177 cancer patients, statin adherence decreased from pre- to
post-cancer diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj):0.91, 95% confidence interval 
(95% CI):0.88-0.94). Statin adherence decreased from pre- to post-cancer
diagnosis among breast (ORadj:0.94, 95% CI:0.90-0.99) and colorectal (ORadj:0.79,
95% CI:0.74-0.85) cancer patients. No difference in adherence was observed among 
prostate cancer patients (ORadj:1.01, 95% CI:0.97-1.05). Prior to cancer
diagnosis, adherence to statins was generally higher among non-Hispanic whites
and multi-race patients than other groups. However, statin adherence after
diagnosis decreased only among these two populations (ORadj:0.85, 95%
CI:0.85-0.92 and ORadj:0.86, 95% CI:0.76-0.97), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial variation in statin medication adherence
following diagnosis by cancer type and race/ethnicity among a large cohort of
prevalent statin users in an integrated health care setting.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Improving our understanding of comorbidity
management and polypharmacy across diverse cancer patient populations is
warranted to develop tailored interventions that improve medication adherence and
reduce disparities in health outcomes.

The Cancer/Testes (CT) Antigen HORMAD1 is germ cell-restricted and plays
developmental roles in generation and processing of meiotic DNA Double Strand
Breaks (DSB). Many tumors aberrantly overexpress HORMAD1 yet the potential impact
of this CT antigen on cancer biology is unclear. We tested a potential role of
HORMAD1 in genome maintenance in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We show that HORMAD1 
re-distributes to nuclear foci and co-localizes with the DSB marker γH2AX in
response to ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic agents. The HORMA domain
and C-term disordered oligomerization motif are necessary for localization of
HORMAD1 to IR-induced foci (IRIF). HORMAD1-depleted cells are sensitive to IR and
camptothecin. In reporter assays, Homologous Recombination (HR)-mediated repair
of targeted ISce1-induced DSBs is attenuated in HORMAD1-depleted cells. In
Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) reporter assays, HORMAD1-depletion does not
affect repair of ISce1-induced DSB. Early DSB signaling events (including ATM
phosphorylation and formation of γH2AX, 53BP1 and NBS1 foci) are intact in
HORMAD1-depleted cells. However, generation of RPA-ssDNA foci and redistribution 
of RAD51 to DSB are compromised in HORMAD1-depleted cells, suggesting that
HORMAD1 promotes DSB resection. HORMAD1-mediated HR is a neomorphic activity that
is independent of its meiotic partners (including HORMAD2 and CCDC36.
Bioinformatic analysis of TCGA data show that similar to known HR pathway genes
HORMAD1 is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of HR genes is
associated with specific mutational profiles (including copy number variation).
Taken together, we identify HORMAD1-dependent DSB repair as a new mechanism of
radioresistance and a probable determinant of mutability in lung adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Adiposity has been linked to both risk and prognosis of colorectal
cancer; however, the impact of different fat areas [visceral (VFA) vs.
subcutaneous fat area (SFA)] is unclear. We investigated associations between
adiposity and biomarkers of inflammation and angiogenesis among patients with
colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Preoperative serum samples and computed tomography scans were obtained
from 188 patients diagnosed with primary invasive stage I-IV colorectal cancer
enrolled in the ColoCare Study. Adiposity was assessed by area-based
quantification of VFA, SFA, and VFA:SFA ratio on spinal levels L3/L4 and L4/L5.
Circulating levels of inflammation (CRP, SAA, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1) and angiogenesis 
(VEGF-A, VEGF-D) were assessed from patient sera on the Meso-Scale-Discoveries
platform. Partial correlations and regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex,
and tumor stage, were performed.
RESULTS: VFA was moderately correlated with CRP and SAA (CRP: L3/L4 and
L4/L5:r=0.21, p=0.01; SAA: L3/L4:r=0.17, p=0.04). The correlation between SFA and
the measured biomarkers were weak (r≤0.13, not significant). The ratio of VFA:SFA
at L3/L4 was moderately correlated with VEGF-A (r=0.28, p=0.0008), and SAA
(r=0.24, p=0.006), and less so with CRP (r=0.18, p=0.04) and sICAM-1 (r=0.18,
p=0.04). Similar correlations were found for VFA:SFA ratio at L4/L5.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed an association between visceral adiposity and biomarkers
of inflammation and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer patients. In particular,
the VFA:SFA ratio was correlated with circulating levels of pro-angiogenic
biomarker VEGF-A.
IMPACT: Our findings support a direct association of visceral adipose tissue with
inflammatory and angiogenic processes, which play fundamental roles in the
development and progression of colorectal cancer.

BACKGROUND: Recreational physical activity has been consistently associated with 
reduced breast cancer risk. Less is known about how family history of breast
cancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.
METHODS: The Sister Study is a cohort of 50,884 women who had a sister with
breast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported all
recreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past 12
months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered in
association with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,
examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporating
characteristics of the family structure.
RESULTS: During follow-up (average 8.4 years), 3,023 cases were diagnosed. Higher
hours/week (HR>=7vs<1=0.77; 95%CI: 0.66-0.90) and MET-hours/week
(HRquartile4vs1=0.75; 95%CI: 0.67-0.85) of physical activity were associated with
reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Hours/week and MET-hours/week were
associated with suggestive increased premenopausal breast cancer risk
(MET-hours/week HRquartile4vs1=1.25; 95%CI: 0.98-1.60). Associations did not vary
with extent of family history. However, the increased risk in premenopausal women
may be limited to those with stronger family history.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with a family history of breast cancer, physical activity
was associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, breast cancer 
risk and was not modified by extent of family history.
IMPACT: This was the first study to examine the association between physical
activity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family history of
breast cancer.

CDH1 and PIK3CA are the two most frequently mutated genes in invasive lobular
carcinoma (ILC) of the breast. Transcription profiling has identified molecular
subtypes for ILC, one of which, immune-related (IR), is associated with gene
expression linked to lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. Here, we report that
deletion of Cdh1, together with activation of Pik3ca in mammary epithelium of
genetically modified mice, leads to formation of IR-ILC-like tumors with immune
cell infiltration, as well as gene expression linked to T-regulatory (Treg) cell 
signaling and activation of targetable immune checkpoint pathways. Interestingly,
these tumors show enhanced Rac1- and Yap-dependent transcription and signaling,
as well as sensitivity to PI3K, Rac1, and Yap inhibitors in culture. Finally,
high-dimensional immunophenotyping in control mouse mammary gland and IR-ILC
tumors by mass cytometry shows dramatic alterations in myeloid and lymphoid
populations associated with immune suppression and exhaustion, highlighting the
potential for therapeutic intervention via immune checkpoint regulators.

PURPOSE: Obesity may alter mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) function and the
pharmacology and efficacy of nanoparticles therapies, such as PEGylated liposomal
doxorubicin (PLD). We aimed to evaluate the relationships between hormone and
chemokine mediators of MPS function and the pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure of PLD 
in obese and normal weight patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer.
METHODS: Hormone and chemokine mediators in obese and normal weight ovarian and
endometrial cancer patients were measured. A separate pharmacology study was
performed that evaluated the relationship between serum hormone concentrations,
MPS function, and PK disposition of PLD in refractory ovarian cancer patients.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between serum
estradiol and body mass index (OR 8.64, 95% CI 2.67-28.0, p < 0.001). Estrone and
testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with MPS function
(ρ = 0.57 and 0.53, p = 0.14 and 0.18, respectively) and inversely correlated
with PLD PK exposure (ρ = - 0.75 and - 0.76, respectively, p = 0.02 for both).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher MPS function resulting in reduced PLD exposure is a potential
mechanism for reduced efficacy of PLD and other nanoparticles observed in obese
patients with cancer. PK simulations suggest higher doses of PLD are required in 
obese patients to achieve similar exposures as standard dosing in normal weight
patients.

Importance: Colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is recommended by all major US
medical organizations but remains underused.
Objective: To identify interventions associated with increasing CRC screening
rates and their effect sizes.
Data Sources: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,
the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January 1, 1996, 
to August 31, 2017. Key search terms included colorectal cancer and screening.
Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of US-based interventions in clinical
settings designed to improve CRC screening test completion in average-risk
adults.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: At least 2 investigators independently extracted
data and appraised each study's risk of bias. Where sufficient data were
available, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain either a pooled risk
ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for screening completion for each type of
intervention.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was completion of CRC screening.
Examination included interventions to increase completion of (1) initial CRC
screening by any recommended modality, (2) colonoscopy after an abnormal initial 
screening test result, and (3) continued rounds of annual fecal blood tests
(FBTs).
Results: The main review included 73 randomized clinical trials comprising
366 766 patients at low or medium risk of bias. Interventions that were
associated with increased CRC screening completion rates compared with usual care
included FBT outreach (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.81-2.81; RD, 22%; 95% CI, 17%-27%),
patient navigation (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.64-2.46; RD, 18%; 95% CI, 13%-23%),
patient education (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36; RD, 4%; 95% CI, 1%-6%), patient
reminders (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41; RD, 3%; 95% CI, 0%-5%), clinician
interventions of academic detailing (RD, 10%; 95% CI, 3%-17%), and clinician
reminders (RD, 13%; 95% CI, 8%-19%). Combinations of interventions (clinician
interventions or navigation added to FBT outreach) were associated with greater
increases than single components (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.29; RD, 7%; 95% CI,
3%-11%). Repeated mailed FBTs with navigation were associated with increased
annual FBT completion (RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.91-2.29; RD, 39%; 95% CI, 29%-49%).
Patient navigation was not associated with colonoscopy completion after an
initial abnormal screening test result (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.60; RD, 14%; 95%
CI, 0%-29%).
Conclusions and Relevance: Fecal blood test outreach and patient navigation,
particularly in the context of multicomponent interventions, were associated with
increased CRC screening rates in US trials. Fecal blood test outreach should be
incorporated into population-based screening programs. More research is needed on
interventions to increase adherence to continued FBTs, follow-up of abnormal
initial screening test results, and cost-effectiveness and other implementation
barriers for more intensive interventions, such as navigation.

The use of traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine (TCAM) for cancer
may influence the delivery or effectiveness of conventional cancer treatment. In 
this systematic review, we aimed to (1) summarise the available prevalence data
on traditional medicine use by cancer patients in less developed countries
(LDCs), and (2) stratify the prevalence data by world region and country income
level. A literature search for cancer, TCAM, and low income (LI) and lower-middle
income (LMI) countries was conducted across 5 databases. A total of 2,365
publications were reviewed for eligibility, of which 25 studies met inclusion
criteria. The combined sample size was 6,878 cancer patients, with a median of
54.5% reporting the use of TCAM for cancer care. Of the studies providing data on
the concomitant use of TCAM and conventional cancer treatment (n = 4,872 cancer
patients), a median of 26.7% of participants reported combining the two systems
of medicine. From the data available, it is apparent that TCAM use among cancer
patients in less developed countries is common; however, additional studies are

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether muscle invasion evident on pretreatment imaging
in p16 + oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) correlates with
recurrence.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: Two-hundred and seventy-six patients with p16 + OPSCC treated at a
tertiary referral center from 2003 to 2015 were analyzed. All scans were reviewed
by a dedicated neuroradiologist with subspecialty expertise in head and neck
imaging. Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion to the genioglossus,
hyoglossus, medial pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles was analyzed. Local and
regional recurrence rates were compared between the muscle invasion and no muscle
invasion groups.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients met inclusion criteria with adequate
follow-up data and pretreatment imaging. Patients were predominantly male (87.5% 
male) and smokers (65.6% smokers) with a mean age of 56.7 (standard deviation:
9.0 years). Most commonly invaded muscles in the muscle invasion group were
hyoglossus (57.8%) and genioglossus (56.3%). There was no statistically
significant difference in primary site or nodal recurrence between the combined
group, including definite or possible muscle invasion and the group without
muscle invasion (P = 0.205 and P = 0.569, respectively). Additionally, no
statistically significant difference was present in recurrence-free and
disease-specific survival between the two groups at 3- and 5-year follow-up
(P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion does not appear to be a
predictor of human papilloma virus (+) OPSCC recurrence. Additional studies are
needed to validate our findings. Level of Evidence 4. Laryngoscope, 2018.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly lethal cancer of the lining of
the chest cavity. To expand our understanding of MPM, we conducted a
comprehensive integrated genomic study, including the most detailed analysis of
BAP1 alterations to date. We identified histology-independent molecular
prognostic subsets, and defined a novel genomic subtype with TP53 and SETDB1
mutations and extensive loss of heterozygosity. We also report strong expression 
of the immune checkpoint gene VISTA in epithelioid MPM, strikingly higher than in
other solid cancers, with implications for the immune response to MPM and for its
immunotherapy. Our findings highlight new avenues for further investigation of
MPM biology and novel therapeutic options.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Estimates of disease burden can inform national health
priorities for research, clinical care, and policy. We aimed to estimate health
care use and spending among gastrointestinal (GI) (including luminal, liver, and 
pancreatic) diseases in the United States.
METHODS: We estimated health care use and spending based on the most currently
available administrative claims from commercial and Medicare Supplemental plans, 
data from the GI Quality Improvement Consortium Registry, and national databases.
RESULTS: In 2015, annual health care expenditures for gastrointestinal diseases
totaled $135.9 billion. Hepatitis ($23.3 billion), esophageal disorders ($18.1
billion), biliary tract disease ($10.3 billion), abdominal pain ($10.2 billion), 
and inflammatory bowel disease ($7.2 billion) were the most expensive. Yearly,
there were more than 54.4 million ambulatory visits with a primary diagnosis for 
a GI disease, 3.0 million hospital admissions, and 540,500 all-cause 30-day
readmissions. There were 266,600 new cases of GI cancers diagnosed and 144,300
cancer deaths. Each year, there were 97,700 deaths from non-malignant GI
diseases. An estimated 11.0 million colonoscopies, 6.1 million upper endoscopies,
313,000 flexible sigmoidoscopies, 178,400 upper endoscopic ultrasound
examinations, and 169,500 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
procedures were performed annually. Among average-risk persons ages 50-75 years
who underwent colonoscopy, 34.6% had 1 or more adenomatous polyps, 4.7% had 1 or 
more advanced adenomatous polyps, and 5.7% had 1 or more serrated polyps removed.
CONCLUSIONS: GI diseases contribute substantially to health care use in the
United States. Total expenditures for GI diseases are $135.9 billion dollars
annually-greater than for other common diseases. Expenditures are likely to
continue increasing.

By delivering the concept of clean hydrogen energy and green catalysis to the
biomedical field, engineering of hydrogen-generating nanomaterials for treatment 
of major diseases holds great promise. Leveraging virtue of versatile abilities
of Pd hydride nanomaterials in high/stable hydrogen storage, self-catalytic
hydrogenation, near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and photothermal conversion, 
here we utilize the cubic PdH0.2 nanocrystals for tumour-targeted and
photoacoustic imaging (PAI)-guided hydrogenothermal therapy of cancer. The
synthesized PdH0.2 nanocrystals have exhibited high intratumoural accumulation
capability, clear NIR-controlled hydrogen release behaviours, NIR-enhanced
self-catalysis bio-reductivity, high NIR-photothermal effect and PAI performance.
With these unique properties of PdH0.2 nanocrystals, synergetic hydrogenothermal 
therapy with limited systematic toxicity has been achieved by tumour-targeted
delivery and PAI-guided NIR-controlled release of bio-reductive hydrogen as well 
as generation of heat. This hydrogenothermal approach has presented
a cancer-selective strategy for synergistic cancer treatment.

The ClinGen PTEN Expert Panel was organized by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer
Clinical Domain Working Group to assemble clinicians, researchers, and molecular 
diagnosticians with PTEN expertise to develop specifications to the 2015 ACMG/AMP
Sequence Variant Interpretation Guidelines for PTEN variant interpretation. We
describe finalized PTEN-specific variant classification criteria and outcomes
from pilot testing of 42 variants with benign/likely benign (BEN/LBEN),
pathogenic/likely pathogenic (PATH/LPATH), uncertain significance (VUS), and
conflicting (CONF) ClinVar assertions. Utilizing these rules, classifications
concordant with ClinVar assertions were achieved for 14/15 (93.3%) BEN/LBEN and
16/16 (100%) PATH/LPATH ClinVar consensus variants for an overall concordance of 
96.8% (30/31). The variant where agreement was not reached was a synonymous
variant near a splice donor with noncanonical sequence for which in silico models
cannot predict the native site. Applying these rules to six VUS and five CONF
variants, adding shared internal laboratory data enabled one VUS to be classified
as LBEN and two CONF variants to be as classified as PATH and LPATH. This study
highlights the benefit of gene-specific criteria and the value of sharing
internal laboratory data for variant interpretation. Our PTEN-specific criteria
and expertly reviewed assertions should prove helpful for laboratories and others
curating PTEN variants.

The variant curation guidelines published in 2015 by the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology
(ACMG/AMP) provided the genetics community with a framework to assess variant
pathogenicity; however, these rules are not gene specific. Germline pathogenic
variants in the CDH1 gene cause hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and lobular
breast cancer, a clinically challenging cancer predisposition syndrome that often
requires a multidisciplinary team of experts to be properly managed. Given this
challenge, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Hereditary Cancer Domain
prioritized the development of the CDH1 variant curation expert panel (VCEP) to
develop and implement rules for CDH1 variant classifications. Here, we describe
the CDH1 specifications of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, which were developed and
validated after a systematic evaluation of variants obtained from a cohort of
clinical laboratory data encompassing ∼827,000 CDH1 sequenced alleles. Comparing 
previously reported germline variants that were classified using the 2015
ACMG/AMP guidelines to the CDH1 VCEP recommendations resulted in reduced variants
of uncertain significance and facilitated resolution of variants with conflicted 
assertions in ClinVar. The ClinGen CDH1 VCEP recommends the use of these
CDH1-specific guidelines for the assessment and classification of variants
identified in this clinically actionable gene.

In its landmark paper about Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of
Sequence Variants, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), 
and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) did not address how to use tumor
data when assessing the pathogenicity of germline variants. The Clinical Genome
Resource (ClinGen) established a multidisciplinary working group, the
Germline/Somatic Variant Subcommittee (GSVS) with this focus. The GSVS
implemented a survey to determine current practices of integrating somatic data
when classifying germline variants in cancer predisposition genes. The GSVS then 
reviewed and analyzed available resources of relevant somatic data, and performed
integrative germline variant curation exercises. The committee determined that
somatic hotspots could be systematically integrated into moderate evidence of
pathogenicity (PM1). Tumor RNA sequencing data showing altered splicing may be
considered as strong evidence in support of germline pathogenicity (PVS1) and
tumor phenotypic features such as mutational signatures be considered supporting 
evidence of pathogenicity (PP4). However, at present, somatic data such as focal 
loss of heterozygosity and mutations occurring on the alternative allele are not 
recommended to be systematically integrated, instead, incorporation of this type 
of data should take place under the advisement of multidisciplinary cancer center
tumor-normal sequencing boards.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer incidence is significant in countries, such as South 
Africa, with high burdens of both HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervical
cancer is largely preventable if dysplasia is diagnosed and treated early, but
there is debate regarding the best approaches for screening and treatment,
especially for low-resource settings. Currently South Africa provides Pap smears 
followed by colposcopic biopsy and LEEP if needed in its public health
facilities. We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches for
treating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) among
HIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at a
public HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.
METHODS: Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis of 
data gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. In 
the trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN2+ and eligible for cryotherapy were 
randomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN2+ at six months as
determined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of their
original treatment assignment-received LEEP. "Cure" was then defined as the
absence of disease at 12 months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Health
service costs were estimated using micro-costing between June 2013 and April
2014. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of 3%. Two different
service volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysis
were considered in sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 166 women with CIN2+ were enrolled (86 had LEEP; 80 had
cryotherapy). At 12 months, cumulative loss to follow-up was 12.8% (11/86) for
the LEEP group and 13.8% (11/80) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjusted
intention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was no 
significant difference in efficacy. At 12 months, 83.8% (95% CI 73.8-91.1) of
women with CIN2+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN2+
disease. In contrast, 76.7% (95% CI 66.4-85.2) of women assigned to LEEP were
free from disease. On average, women initially treated with cryotherapy were less
costly per patient randomized at US$ 118.00 (113.91-122.10), and per case "cured"
at US$ 140.90 (136.01-145.79). Women in the LEEP group cost US$ 162.56
(157.90-167.22) per patient randomized and US$ 205.59 (199.70-211.49) per case
cured. In the as-treated analysis, which was based on trial data, LEEP was more
efficacious than cryotherapy; however, the difference was not significant.
Cryotherapy remained more cost-effective than LEEP in all sensitivity and
scenario analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: For this cost-effectiveness analysis, using an intention-to-treat
approach and taking into consideration uncertainty in the clinical and cost
outcomes, a strategy involving cryotherapy plus LEEP if needed at six months was 
dominant to LEEP plus LEEP again at six months if needed for retreatment.
However, compared to other studies comparing LEEP and cryotherapy, the efficacy
results were low in both treatment groups-possibly due to the HIV-positivity of
the participants. Further research is needed, but at present choosing the "right"
treatment option may be less important than ensuring access to treatment and
providing careful monitoring of treatment outcomes.

STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known to
contribute to cervical carcinogenesis, yet other co-factors that may contribute
to oncogenesis are poorly understood. Herein, we examine whether Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV), two onco-modulatory viruses, are
associated with HPV-mediated cervical neoplastic progression.
METHODS OF STUDY: Sixty patient cervical brush samples from a study of North
Carolina women were obtained. HPV RNA positivity was determined by Aptima testing
(Hologic Corporation). The level of viral transcripts for EBV and CMV were
quantified (RT-PCR analysis), and co-infection status with HPV was then compared 
to the patient's cervical cytology grade.
RESULTS: Over one third (38.3%) of the study population was CMV-positive, while
43.3% was EBV-positive. When sample data were stratified by cytology grade, 36.5%
(19/52) of normal patients, 75% (3/4) of low-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions (LSIL) and 100% (4/4) of patients with high-grade SIL (HSIL) were EBV
positive. Conversely, 35.2% (18/52) of normal patients, 25% (1/4) of patients
with LSIL and 50% (2/4) of patients with HSIL were CMV positive. When examining
only HPV-positive associated HSIL,100% (4/4) were positive for both HPV and EBV
detection. This suggests co-viral detection with HPV and EBV is associated with
more advanced HSIL cervical lesions, while CMV displayed no clear association
with higher grade of cervical cytology.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-viral detection with EBV may increase the oncogenicity and/or
serve as a viral marker of progression to HPV-associated high-grade cervical
dysplasia. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

E-selectin mediates the rolling of circulating leukocytes during inflammatory
processes. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in European and Asian 
individuals have identified the ABO locus associated with E-selectin levels.
Using Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
data in 2,249 African Americans (AAs) from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), we
examined genome-wide associations with soluble E-selectin levels. In addition to 
replicating known signals at ABO, we identified a novel association of a common
loss-of-function, missense variant in FUT6 (rs17855739,p.Glu274Lys, p=9.02 x
10-24) with higher soluble E-selectin levels. This variant is considerably more
common in populations of African-ancestry compared to non-African ancestry
populations. We replicated the association of FUT6 p.Glu274Lys with higher
soluble E-selectin in an independent population of 748 AAs from the Women's
Health Initiative and identified an additional pleiotropic association with
vitamin B12 levels. Despite the broad role of both selectins and
fucosyltransferases in various inflammatory, immune and cancer-related processes,
we were unable to identify any additional disease associations of the FUT6
p.Glu274Lys variant in an EMR-based phenome-wide association scan of over 9,000
African Americans.

OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests the α2-adrenoreceptor agonist dexmedetomidine
may promote metastasis of cancer cells. In this study we sought to evaluate the
impact of dexmedetomidine administration on the survival of children and
adolescents with cancer.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center.
PATIENTS: Children and adolescents who had undergone cytoreductive surgery with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
INTERVENTION: Intraoperative and/or early postoperative (within 24 hours of
surgery) administration of dexmedetomidine.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable cox proportional hazard models were used to assess
the association between dexmedetomidine administration and progression free
survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).
MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified. The median age was 12 years,
42% were female, and 35% received dexmedetomidine. There were no significant
differences between the baseline and perioperative characteristics of patients
who received dexmedetomidine and those who did not. In the multivariable
analysis, the administration of dexmedetomidine was not associated with PFS
(HR = 1.20, 95% CI [0.60-2.41], p = .606) or OS (HR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.35-1.85],
p = .611).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of children and adolescents who had
undergone a major oncologic surgery, the intraoperative and/or early
postoperative administration of dexmedetomidine was not associated with survival.

Addressing social determinants of health (SDoH) has been acknowledged as an
essential objective for the promotion of both population health and health
equity. Extant literature has identified seven potential areas of investment to
address SDoH: investments in sexual and reproductive health and family planning, 
early learning and child care, education, universal health care, as well as
investments to reduce child poverty, ensure sustainable economic development, and
control health hazards. The aim of this paper is to produce a 'report card' on
Canada's success in reducing socioeconomic and health inequities pertaining to
these seven policy domains, and to assess how Canadian trends compare to those in
the United Kingdom (UK), a country with a similar health and welfare system.
Summarising evidence from published studies and national statistics, we found
that Canada's best successes were in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in early
learning and child care and reproductive health-specifically in improving equity 
in maternal employment and infant mortality. Comparative data suggest that
Canada's outcomes in the latter areas were like those in the UK. In contrast,
Canada's least promising equity outcomes were in relation to health hazard
control (specifically, tobacco) and child poverty. Though Canada and the UK
observed similar inequities in smoking, Canada's slow upward trend in child
poverty prevalence is distinct from the UK's small but steady reduction of child 
poverty. This divergence from the UK's trends indicates that alternative
investment types and levels may be needed in Canada to achieve similar outcomes
to those in the UK.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the impact of lifestyle patterns on
survival following breast cancer. We aimed to identify distinct lifestyle
patterns based on five behavior/dietary exposures among a population-based sample
of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and to examine their association with
subsequent survival.
METHODS: In the Carolina Breast Cancer Study Phases I/II, we interviewed 1,808
women aged 20-74 following diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. We determined
using the National Death Index (717 deaths, 427 from breast cancer; median
follow-up 13.56 years). We assessed lifestyle patterns using a latent class
analysis based on five behavioral and dietary exposures: current versus
never/former smokers; low versus high vegetable and fruit intake; high and
low/moderate, versus no alcohol consumption; and no and low/moderate, vs. high
regular physical activity. We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality,
and cause-specific and subdistribution HRs for breast cancer-specific mortality
within 5 years and 13 years post-diagnosis conditional on 5-year survival.
RESULTS: We identified three distinct lifestyle patterns: Healthy Behavior and
Diet (n=916); Healthy Behavior and Unhealthy Diet (n=624); and Unhealthy Behavior
and Diet (n=268). The Unhealthy (vs. Healthy) Behavior and Diet pattern was
associated with a 13-year conditional all-cause mortality HR of 1.4
(95%CI=1.1-1.9) and with 13-year conditional breast cancer-specific and
subdistribution HRs of 1.2 (95%CI=0.79-1.9) and 1.2 (95%CI=0.77-1.8),
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and dietary patterns can be used to identify lifestyle
patterns that influence survival patterns following breast cancer diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: For successful endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer (EGC),
absolute criteria for a curative en bloc resection were initially established to 
include predominantly differentiated mucosal lesions ≤ 2 cm in diameter without
ulceration. These indications were subsequently expanded to include larger,
ulcerated, and predominantly undifferentiated mucosal lesions. In addition,
differentiated type adenocarcinomas ≤ 3 cm with slight submucosal invasion of
< 500 µm (pT1b1) are regarded as "curative" under the expanded criteria. However,
data derived from studies of surgical specimens in patients with pT1b1 EGC have
yielded varying rates of lymph node metastasis (LNM).
METHOD: A systemic review was conducted using the pooled analysis to calculate
the incidence of LNM in pT1b1 EGC, and to investigate whether using a cut-off
value of < 300 µm would decrease the risk of LNM in patients with submucosal EGC.
RESULTS: Nineteen articles were included. 1507 patients with pT1b1 EGC met the
expanded indications. The incidence of LNM was 3% (45 out of 1507 patients). In a
subgroup analysis of three studies, there was no significant difference in the
LNM between pT1b EGC < 300 µm and < 500 µm [3/121(2.5%) vs. 5/180 (2.8%)] (OR
0.89, 95% CI 0.22-3.54).
CONCLUSION: Overall, expanding the indications for endoscopic resection of EGC to
include lesions ≤ 3 cm T1b1 is associated with a potential risk of LNM of 3%. In 
countries outside of Japan, we found a slightly higher risk of LNM (4.0%). These 
estimates of LNM should be incorporated into decisions regarding further
management of patients with EGC ≤ 3 cm who are found to have slight submucosal
invasion (< 500 µm) in an ESD specimen. Standardization of specimen handling and 
histological evaluation is essential if the Japanese results of endoscopic
treatment for EGC are to be successfully applied in other parts of the world.

Impaired immunity in patients with late-stage cancer is not limited to antitumor 
responses, as demonstrated by poor vaccination protection and high susceptibility
to infection1-3. This has been largely attributed to chemotherapy-induced
impairment of innate immunity, such as neutropenia2, whereas systemic effects of 
tumors on hematopoiesis and adoptive immunity remain incompletely understood.
Here we observed anemia associated with severe deficiency of CD8+ T cell
responses against pathogens in treatment-naive mice bearing large tumors.
Specifically, we identify CD45+ erythroid progenitor cells (CD71+TER119+; EPCs)
as robust immunosuppressors. CD45+ EPCs, induced by tumor growth-associated
extramedullary hematopoiesis, accumulate in the spleen to become a major
population, outnumbering regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs). The CD45+ EPC transcriptome closely resembles that of
MDSCs, and, like MDSCs, reactive oxygen species production is a major mechanism
underlying CD45+ EPC-mediated immunosuppression. Similarly, an immunosuppressive 
CD45+ EPC population was detected in patients with cancer who have anemia. These 
findings identify a major population of immunosuppressive cells that likely
contributes to the impaired T cell responses commonly observed in patients with
advanced cancer.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Previous studies reported an association of the bacteria
Helicobacter pylori, the primary cause of gastric cancer, and risk of colorectal 
cancer (CRC). However, these findings have been inconsistent, appear to vary with
population characteristics, and may be specific for virulence factor VacA. To
more thoroughly evaluate the potential association of H pylori antibodies with
CRC risk, we assembled a large consortium of cohorts representing diverse
populations in the United States.
METHODS: We used H pylori multiplex serologic assays to analyze serum samples
from 4063 incident cases of CRC, collected before diagnosis, and 4063 matched
individuals without CRC (controls) from 10 prospective cohorts for antibody
responses to 13 H pylori proteins, including virulence factors VacA and CagA. The
association of sero-positivity to H pylori proteins, as well as protein-specific 
antibody level, with odds of CRC was determined by conditional logistic
regression.
RESULTS: Overall 40% of controls and 41% of cases were H. pylori sero-positive
(odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.20). H pylori VacA-specific
sero-positivity was associated with an 11% increased odds of CRC (OR, 1.11; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.22), and this association was particularly strong among African
Americans (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.95). Additionally, odds of CRC increased with
level of VacA antibody in the overall cohort (P=.008) and specifically among
African Americans (P=.007).
CONCLUSION: In an analysis of a large consortium of cohorts representing diverse 
populations, we found serologic responses to H pylori VacA to associate with
increased risk of CRC risk-particularly for African Americans. Future studies
should seek to understand whether this marker is related to virulent H pylori
strains carried in these populations.

Transition metal complexes are of increasing interest as photosensitizers in
photodynamic therapy (PDT) and, more recently, for photochemotherapy (PCT). In
recent years, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have emerged as promising systems for 
both PDT and PCT. Their rich photochemical and photophysical properties derive
from a variety of excited-state electronic configurations accessible with visible
and near-infrared light, and these properties can be exploited for both energy-
and electron-transfer processes that can yield highly potent oxygen-dependent
and/or oxygen-independent photobiological activity. Selected examples highlight
the use of rational design in coordination chemistry to control the lowest-energy
triplet excited-state configurations for eliciting a particular type of
photoreactivity for PDT and/or PCT effects. These principles are also discussed
in the context of the development of TLD1433, the first Ru(II)-based
photosensitizer for PDT to enter a human clinical trial. The design of TLD1433
arose from a tumor-centered approach, as part of a complete PDT package that
includes the light component and the protocol for treating non-muscle invasive
bladder cancer. Briefly, this review summarizes the challenges to bringing PDT
into mainstream cancer therapy. It considers the chemical and photophysical
solutions that transition metal complexes offer, and it puts into context the
multidisciplinary effort needed to bring a new drug to clinical trial.

BACKGROUND: The majority of urothelial cancers (UC) harbor alterations in
retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway genes that can lead to loss of Rb tumour suppressor
function. Palbociclib is an oral, selective inhibitor of CDK 4/6 that restores Rb
function and promotes cell cycle arrest.
METHODS: In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC 
molecularly selected for p16 loss and intact Rb by tumour immunohistochemistry
received palbociclib 125 mg p.o. daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Primary
endpoint was progression-free survival at 4 months (PFS4) using a Simon's
two-stage design. Next-generation sequencing including Rb pathway alterations was
conducted.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled and two patients (17%) achieved PFS4 with 
insufficient activity to advance to stage 2. No responses were seen. Median PFS
was 1.9 months (95% CI 1.8-3.7 months) and median overall survival was 6.3 months
(95% CI 2.2-12.6 months). Fifty-eight percent of patients had grade ≥3
hematologic toxicity. There were no CDKN2A alterations found and no correlation
of Rb pathway alterations with clinical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib did not demonstrate meaningful activity in selected
patients with platinum-refractory metastatic UC. Further development of
palbociclib should only be considered with improved integral biomarker selection 
or in rational combination with other therapies.

OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests peer support (PS) is as an effective strategy for
enhancing prevention and control of chronic and infectious diseases, including
cancer. This systematic scoping review examines the range and variety of
interventions on the use of PS across the cancer care continuum.
METHOD: We used a broad definition of PS to capture a wide-range of interventions
and characterize the current status of the field. Literature searches were
conducted using PubMed, SCOPUS, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles
published from January 2011 to June 2016. We screened the title and abstracts of 
2087 articles, followed by full-text screening of 420 articles, resulting in a
final sample of 242 articles of which the most recent 100 articles were reviewed 
(published June 2014 to May 2016).
RESULTS: A number of the recent intervention studies focused on breast cancer
(32%, breast cancer only) or multiple cancer sites (23%). Although the
interventions spanned all phases of the cancer care continuum, only 2% targeted
end-of-life care. Seventy-six percent focused on clinical outcomes (e.g.,
screening, treatment adherence) and 72% on reducing health disparities.
Interventions were primarily phone-based (44%) or delivered in a clinic setting
(44%). Only a few studies (22%) described the impact of providing PS on peer
supporters.
CONCLUSION: PS appears to be a widely used approach to address needs across the
cancer care continuum, with many opportunities to expand its reach.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is an important health concern
among survivors of breast cancer. However, few studies to date have examined
whether trajectories of CVD risk and major risk factors are worse among women
with a breast cancer diagnosis compared with those without.
METHODS: Changes in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood 
pressure, and 10-year CVD risk were compared between women with (813 women) and
without (1049 women) an incident breast cancer diagnosis while they were enrolled
in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Sister Study cohort.
Blood pressure and adiposity measures were collected by trained examiners at an
enrollment visit (≥1 year before breast cancer diagnosis) and a second home visit
4 to 11 years later (≥1 year after breast cancer diagnosis). The
non-laboratory-based Framingham risk score, a measure of 10-year general CVD
risk, was calculated at both the enrollment and second visits. All analyses were 
stratified by menopausal status at the time of enrollment.
RESULTS: Women who were premenopausal at the time of enrollment experienced
moderate increases in weight, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and
CVD risk over the study period. Those who were postmenopausal at the time of
enrollment demonstrated little change in weight, but were found to have increases
in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and CVD risk. In both groups,
changes over time did not differ significantly according to breast cancer status.
Neither chemotherapy nor endocrine therapy were found to be associated with
greater increases in CVD risk or risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current study cohort, changes over time in CVD risk,
adiposity measures, and blood pressure were similar between women who developed
an incident breast cancer and those who did not.

BACKGROUND: Multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are common among older patients
with cancer; however, the exclusion of these patients from clinical trials has
resulted in scarce knowledge concerning outcomes, resulting in variations in
treatment. Superficial bladder cancer (SBC) disproportionately affects older
adults, yet to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined whether
treatment improves long-term survival. In the current study, the authors
evaluated the association between treatment of SBC and 10-year mortality in
medically complex older adults.
METHODS: The authors identified 1800 older (aged ≥60 years) patients with SBC
(American Joint Committee on Cancer stage ≤I) from 2 community-based health
systems who received treatment (bladder instillation and/or transurethral
resection) or observation. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed
adjusting for age, sex, race, health system, stage of disease/grade, and MCC (≥2 
baseline chronic conditions). Propensity score analysis using stabilized inverse 
probability of treatment weights was used to compare 10-year mortality in the 2
treatment groups with adjustment for covariates.
RESULTS: Overall, 1485 patients (82.5%) and 315 patients (17.5%) received
treatment and observation, respectively. In unweighted multivariable analysis,
treatment was associated with a 30% reduction in death (adjusted hazard ratio
[HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.58-0.85 [P<.01]) and MCC with a
72% increase in death (adjusted HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.44-2.05 [P<.01]). Weighted
analysis with adjustment (doubly robust) also demonstrated a survival benefit for
treatment (adjusted HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.84 [P<.01]).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated a clinically
meaningful association between cancer treatment and survival benefit in older,
medically complex patients with SBC, even after adjustment for medical
complexity. These data provide a foundation for future work aimed at
personalizing the treatment guidance of older patients with cancer with MCC.

BACKGROUND: Telehealth employs technology to connect patients to the right
healthcare resources at the right time. Women are high utilizers of healthcare
with gender-specific health issues that may benefit from the convenience and
personalization of telehealth. Thus, we produced an evidence map describing the
quantity, distribution, and characteristics of evidence assessing the
effectiveness of telehealth services designed for women.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE® (via PubMed®) and Embase® from inception through
March 20, 2018. We screened systematic reviews (SRs), randomized trials, and
quasi-experimental studies using predetermined eligibility criteria. Articles
meeting inclusion criteria were identified for data abstraction. To assess
emerging trends, we also conducted a targeted search of ClinicalTrials.gov .
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four primary studies and three SRs were eligible for 
abstraction. We grouped studies into focused areas of research: maternal health
(n = 96), prevention (n = 46), disease management (n = 63), family planning
(n = 9), high-risk breast cancer assessment (n = 10), intimate partner violence
(n = 7), and mental health (n = 3). Most interventions focused on phone as the
primary telehealth modality and featured healthcare team-to-patient communication
and were limited in duration (e.g., < 12 weeks). Few interventions were conducted
with older women (≥ 60 years) or in racially/ethnically diverse populations.
There are few SRs in this area and limited evidence regarding newer telehealth
modalities such as mobile-based applications or short message service/texting.
Targeted search of clinical.trials.gov yielded 73 ongoing studies that show a
shift in the use of non-telephone modalities.
DISCUSSION: Our systematic evidence map highlights gaps in the existing
literature, such as a lack of studies in key women's health areas (intimate
partner violence, mental health), and a dearth of relevant SRs. With few existing
SRs in this literature, there is an opportunity for examining effects,
efficiency, and acceptability across studies to inform efforts at implementing
telehealth for women.

BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease (CD) is highly heterogeneous, due in large part to
variability in cellular processes that underlie the natural history of CD,
thereby confounding effective therapy. There is a critical need to advance
understanding of the cellular mechanisms that drive CD heterogeneity.
METHODS: We performed small RNA sequencing of adult colon tissue from CD and NIBD
controls. Colonic epithelial cells and immune cells were isolated from colonic
tissues, and microRNA-31 (miR-31) expression was measured. miR-31 expression was 
measured in colonoid cultures generated from controls and patients with CD. We
performed small RNA-sequencing of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colon and
ileum biopsies from treatment-naive pediatric patients with CD and controls and
collected data on disease features and outcomes.
RESULTS: Small RNA-sequencing and microRNA profiling in the colon revealed 2
distinct molecular subtypes, each with different clinical associations. Notably, 
we found that miR-31 expression was a driver of these 2 subtypes and, further,
that miR-31 expression was particularly pronounced in epithelial cells. Colonoids
revealed that miR-31 expression differences are preserved in this ex vivo system.
In adult patients, low colonic miR-31 expression levels at the time of surgery
were associated with worse disease outcome as measured by need for an end
ileostomy and recurrence of disease in the neoterminal ileum. In pediatric
patients, lower miR-31 expression at the time of diagnosis was associated with
future development of fibrostenotic ileal CD requiring surgeryCONCLUSIONS. These 
findings represent an important step forward in designing more effective clinical
trials and developing personalized CD therapies.

PURPOSE: The development and implementation of an operational productivity tool
in an academic cancer treatment center are described.
SUMMARY: Based on the increasing complexity of care delivery within the oncology 
setting, solutions were explored within Cleveland Clinic pharmacy's productivity 
model. Data were electronically captured based on orders processed through the
outpatient oncology setting, including hazardous and nonhazardous medications.
Based on current workflow, inpatient and outpatient orders were reviewed in
productivity metrics. The metric defining the variability of the workload itself 
was weighted dispense type as it was the best representation of a mixed-skill
workflow. After conducting workflow process mapping, discrete measurable steps
were assessed and evaluated daily. Operational components of interest included
pharmacist verification activities and technician compounding activities.
Historical production data were sampled for assigning relative value units (RVUs)
respective to time to normalize workload into a common unit (i.e., 1 hour) and to
relate work demand in a highly variable setting. RVUs were assigned and
delineated by cognitive and distributive activities for pharmacists and
technicians, respectively. The Cleveland Clinic department of pharmacy developed 
a productivity tool to retrospectively measure workload involving time to review,
verify, reconstitute, admix, and deliver chemotherapeutic agents. The weighting
of each medication allowed for precise and meaningful evaluation of productivity.
With RVUs assigned to 2 years of operational metrics, there now exists an
opportunity to monitor performance trends within the cancer treatment center
pharmacy. The data are readily retrievable within the electronic health record.
CONCLUSION: The productivity data provided precise information to assess trends
in operations within the pharmacy of an outpatient cancer treatment center.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the natural history of treated and untreated cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia-2 (CIN2) among HIV-positive women.
METHODS: Participants were women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study
between 1994 and 2013. 104 HIV-positive women diagnosed with CIN2 before age 46
were selected, contributing 2,076 visits over a median of 10 years (IQR 5-16).
The outcome of interest was biopsy-confirmed CIN2 progression, defined as CIN3 or
invasive cervical cancer. CIN2 treatment was abstracted from medical records.
RESULTS: The majority of women were African American (53%), current smokers (53%)
and had a median age of 33 years at CIN2 diagnosis. Among the 104 HIV-positive
women, 62 (59.6%) did not receive CIN2 treatment. Twelve HIV-positive women
(11.5%) showed CIN2 progression to CIN3; none were diagnosed with cervical
cancer. There was no difference in the median time to progression between
CIN2-treated and -untreated HIV-positive women (2.9 vs. 2.7 years, p=0.41). CIN2 
treatment was not associated with CIN2 progression in multivariate analysis (aHR 
[adjusted hazard ratio] 1.82; 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.54, 7.11), adjusting
for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and CD4+ T cell count. In
HIV-positive women, each increase of 100 CD4+ T cells was associated with a 33%
decrease in CIN2 progression (aHR 0.67; 95% CI 0.47, 0.88), adjusting for CIN2
treatment and cART.
CONCLUSIONS: CIN2 progression is uncommon in this population, regardless of CIN2

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is convincingly associated with gastric cancer,
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and certain lymphomas, but its role in other cancer
types remains controversial. To test the hypothesis that there are additional
cancer types with high prevalence of EBV, we determined EBV viral expression in
all the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) samples (n 
= 10,396) from 32 different tumor types. We found that EBV was present in gastric
adenocarcinoma and lymphoma, as expected, and was also present in >5% of samples 
in 10 additional tumor types. For most samples, EBV transcript levels were low,
which suggests that EBV was likely present due to infected infiltrating B cells. 
In order to determine if there was a difference in the B-cell populations, we
assembled B-cell receptors for each sample and found B-cell receptor abundance (P
≤ 1.4 × 10-20) and diversity (P ≤ 8.3 × 10-27) were significantly higher in
EBV-positive samples. Moreover, diversity was independent of B-cell abundance,
suggesting that the presence of EBV was associated with an increased and altered 
B-cell population. IMPORTANCE Around 20% of human cancers are associated with
viruses. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) contributes to gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, and certain lymphomas, but its role in other cancer types remains
controversial. We assessed the prevalence of EBV in RNA-seq from 32 tumor types
in the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and found EBV to be present in >5% of
samples in 12 tumor types. EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells and in B
cells causes proliferation. We hypothesized that the low expression of EBV in
most of the tumor types was due to infiltration of B cells into the tumor. The
increase in B-cell abundance and diversity in subjects where EBV was detected in 
the tumors strengthens this hypothesis. Overall, we found that EBV was associated
with an increased and altered immune response. This result is not evidence of
causality, but a potential novel biomarker for tumor immune status.

Androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) is crucial for prostate cancer
progression and therapeutic resistance. We show that, independent of ligand,
AR-V7 binds both androgen-responsive elements (AREs) and non-canonical sites
distinct from full-length AR (AR-FL) targets. Consequently, AR-V7 not only
recapitulates AR-FL's partial functions but also regulates an additional gene
expression program uniquely via binding to gene promoters rather than ARE
enhancers. AR-V7 binding and AR-V7-mediated activation at these unique targets do
not require FOXA1 but rely on ZFX and BRD4. Knockdown of ZFX or select unique
targets of AR-V7/ZFX, or BRD4 inhibition, suppresses growth of
castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also define an AR-V7 direct target
gene signature that correlates with AR-V7 expression in primary tumors,
differentiates metastatic prostate cancer from normal, and predicts poor
prognosis. Thus, AR-V7 has both ARE/FOXA1 canonical and ZFX-directed
non-canonical regulatory functions in the evolution of anti-androgen therapeutic 
resistance, providing information to guide effective therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Several foods and nutrients have been linked to the development of
prostate cancer, but the association between healthy dietary patterns and
prostate cancer aggressiveness is less studied. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (MED) and Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores and prostate cancer
aggressiveness by race.
METHODS: Data from the population-based, case-only North Carolina-Louisiana
Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) were used to examine the association between diet 
quality, measured by MED and DASH scores, and prostate cancer aggressiveness in
1899 African American (AA) and European American (EA) research subjects. Dietary 
intake was assessed using a modified National Cancer Institute Diet History
Questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for high versus low-intermediate
aggressive prostate cancer.
RESULTS: Higher MED scores were inversely associated with high aggressive
prostate cancer overall (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.95 for high versus low
scores); results were similar for AA and EA men. A weaker inverse association
between DASH scores and prostate cancer aggressiveness was found (OR: 0.76; 95%
CI: 0.55, 1.06).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality, as represented by a Mediterranean-style diet or
DASH diet, may reduce the odds of high aggressive prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Male breast cancer (BC) is rare, representing approximately 1% of
cancers that occur in men and approximately 1% of all BCs worldwide. Because male
BC is rare, not much is known about the disease, and treatment recommendations
are typically extrapolated from data available from clinical trials enrolling
female BC patients.
METHODS: We review the epidemiology, risk factors, prognosis, and the varied
molecular and clinicopathologic features that characterize male BC. In addition, 
we summarize the available data for the use of systemic therapy in the treatment 
of male BC and explore the ongoing development of targeted therapeutic agents for
the treatment of this subgroup of BCs.
RESULTS: There are important biological differences between male and female BC.
Male BC is almost exclusively hormone receptor positive (+), including the
androgen receptor (AR), and is associated with an increased prevalence of BRCA2
germline mutations, especially in men with increased risk for developing
high-risk BC. Additional research is warranted to better characterize male BC. To
accomplish this, a multi-national consortium approach, such as the International 
Male Breast Cancer Program, is needed in response to the scarcity of patients.
This approach allows the pooling of information from a large number of men with
BC and the creation of registries for future therapeutic-focused clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the unique biology of BC in men, promising new therapeutic
targets are currently under investigation, including the use of poly-ADP-ribose
polymerase inhibitors or AR-targeted agents either as monotherapy or in
combination with other agents.

PURPOSE: Metformin has been associated with a reduced incidence of prostate
cancer and improved prostate cancer outcomes. However, whether race modifies the 
association between metformin use and prostate cancer aggressiveness remains
uncertain. The association between metformin use and prostate cancer
aggressiveness was examined separately in Black Americans (Blacks) and White
Americans (Whites).
METHODS: The study population consisted of 305 Black and 195 White research
participants with incident prostate cancer and self-reported diabetes from the
North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project. High-aggressive prostate cancer
was defined using a composite measure of Gleason sum, prostate-specific antigen, 
and clinical stage. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the
association between metformin use and high-aggressive prostate cancer at
diagnosis, separately among Whites and Blacks, with adjustment for age, screening
history, site, education, insurance, and body mass index.
RESULTS: Metformin use was associated positively with high-aggressive prostate
cancer in Blacks (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.05, 3.83). By contrast, a weak inverse
association between metformin use and high-aggressive prostate cancer was found
in Whites (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.34, 1.85).
CONCLUSIONS: The association between metformin use and prostate cancer
aggressiveness may be modified by race.

BRCA1 functions in homologous recombination (HR) both up- and downstream of DNA
end resection. However, in cells with 53BP1 gene knockout (KO), BRCA1 is
dispensable for the initiation of resection, but whether BRCA1 activity is
entirely redundant after end resection is unclear. Here, we found that 53bp1 KO
rescued the embryonic viability of a Brca1ΔC/ΔC mouse model that harbors a stop
codon in the coiled-coil domain. However, Brca1ΔC/ΔC;53bp1-/- mice were
susceptible to tumor formation, lacked Rad51 foci, and were sensitive to PARP
inhibitor (PARPi) treatment, indicative of suboptimal HR. Furthermore, BRCA1
mutant cancer cell lines were dependent on truncated BRCA1 proteins that retained
the ability to interact with PALB2 for 53BP1 KO induced RAD51 foci and PARPi
resistance. Our data suggest that the overall efficiency of 53BP1 loss of
function induced HR may be BRCA1 mutation dependent. In the setting of 53BP1 KO, 
hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins are active downstream of end resection, promoting
RAD51 loading and PARPi resistance.

Background: Health care maintenance (HCM) is reduced among inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) patients. This study aims to characterize rates of HCM in a closely
monitored subpopulation-postpartum women with IBD-and identify predictors of
noncompliance.
Methods: A national prospective pregnancy registry was utilized to collect
completion rates of HCM recommendations (cervical cancer screening; osteoporosis 
screening; pneumococcal, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines).
Completion of a recommendation at least once during follow-up was sufficient,
except for influenza vaccine, which was assessed yearly. Patients were classified
by drug exposures: immunomodulator (Group A), biologic (Group B), combination
therapy (Group AB), and unexposed. Confounders assessed were steroid exposure,
IBD flare, IBD care site, primary care provider (PCP) access, marital status,
income, education level, and race.
Results: There were 628 postpartum IBD women with at least 1 year of follow-up.
HCM rates were as follows: cervical cancer screening (84%), osteoporosis
screening (54%), pneumococcal (50%), hepatitis A (61%), hepatitis B (81%), and
influenza (72%) vaccines. The unexposed group demonstrated lower pneumococcal
vaccination rates than groups A, B, and AB. Group B demonstrated lower cervical
cancer screening rates than the unexposed. PCP access and low education predicted
hepatitis vaccine noncompliance. Unmarried status and low income predicted
cervical cancer screening noncompliance. Low income predicted influenza vaccine
noncompliance.
Conclusions: Postpartum women have multiple providers, yet they complete HCM at
suboptimal rates. Risk factors include biologic exposure, unmarried status, low
income, low education, and access to a PCP. Awareness among providers and
patients is important and needs to be enhanced.

A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of
pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with which
to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a 
diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is
substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in
solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic
target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich
C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal
tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found
that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase
inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase
domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using
a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published
Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify
compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2
destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2
degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling
and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of
TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the
cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small
molecule-induced protein down-regulation through drug "off-targets" might be
relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.

Diagnostic assessment of assumptions for external validity: An example using data
in metastatic colorectal cancer.

Sanoff).

BACKGROUND: Methods developed to estimate intervention effects in external target
populations assume that all important effect measure modifiers have been
identified and appropriately modeled. Propensity score-based diagnostics can be
used to assess the plausibility of these assumptions for weighting methods.
METHODS: We demonstrate the use of these diagnostics when assessing the
transportability of treatment effects from the standard of care for metastatic
colorectal cancer control arm in a phase III trial (HORIZON III) to a target
population of 1,942 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65+ years.
RESULTS: In an unadjusted comparison, control arm participants had lower
mortality compared with target population patients treated with the standard of
care therapy [trial vs. target hazard ratio (HR)= 0.72, 95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.58, 0.89]. Applying inverse odds of sampling weights attenuated the trial
vs. target HR (weighted HR=0.96, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.26). However, whether unadjusted
or weighted, hazards did not appear proportional. At 6 months of follow-up,
mortality was lower in the weighted trial population than the target population
(weighted trial vs. target risk difference (RD) = -0.07, 95% CI -0.13, -0.01),
but not at 12 months (weighted RD= 0.00, 95% CI: -0.09, 0.09).
CONCLUSION: These diagnostics suggest direct transport of treatment effects from 
HORIZON III to the Medicare population is not valid. However, the proposed
sampling model might allow valid transport of the treatment effects on
longer-term mortality from HORIZON III to the Medicare population treated in
clinical practice.

Identification of a few cancer driver mutation genes from a much larger number of
passenger mutation genes in cancer samples remains a highly challenging task.
Here, a novel method for distinguishing the driver genes from the passenger genes
by effective integration of somatic mutation data and molecular interaction data 
using a maximal mutational impact function (MaxMIF) is presented. When evaluated 
on six somatic mutation datasets of Pan-Cancer and 19 datasets of different
cancer types from TCGA, MaxMIF almost always significantly outperforms all the
existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive accuracy, sensitivity,
and specificity. It recovers about 30% more known cancer genes in 500 top-ranked 
candidate genes than the best among the other tools evaluated. MaxMIF is also
highly robust to data perturbation. Intriguingly, MaxMIF is able to identify
potential cancer driver genes, with strong experimental data support. Therefore, 
MaxMIF can be very useful for identifying or prioritizing cancer driver genes in 
the increasing number of available cancer genomic data.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to define dietary supplement (DS)
use by cancer patients and to investigate factors associated with DS use during
cancer treatment.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of adults diagnosed with breast, colorectal,
lung, or prostate cancer in 2010-2012 at the University of North Carolina
Comprehensive Cancer Center was conducted. Questionnaires were sent to 1794
patients. Phone calls were made to nonrespondents. The authors described type of 
DS use before, during, and after initial cancer treatment, source of advice on DS
use, and used logistic regression to investigate the association of DS use during
or after cancer treatment with clinical/sociodemographic characteristics and
source of advice.
RESULTS: Six hundred and three (34%) patients completed the questionnaires.
Nonvitamin nonmineral DS use during initial cancer treatments was common: any
cancer treatment (49%), chemotherapy (52%), and radiation therapy (51%). Among
patients seeking advice on DS use, 75% reported professional sources, 44%
reported media sources, and 47% reported lay sources. DS use during cancer
treatment was strongly predicted by prior DS use, followed by prior complementary
therapies' use, receiving DS advice from a cancer care provider, being female,
and higher education level.
CONCLUSION: DS use is common and persists during cancer treatment. Among DS users
during treatment, 18% used an herbal supplement, which are likely to carry
greater risk of interaction with chemotherapy agents compared with vitamin,
mineral, and other supplements. Although many respondents sought DS advice from
professional sources, the use of nonprofessional sources remains high.

Chemo-immunotherapy represents an appealing approach to improving cancer
treatment. Simultaneously administrating chemotherapeutics with immunoadjuvants
can elicit potent tumor death and immune responses. Herein, high density
lipoprotein (HDL) inspired immune lipoprotein was proposed for relay drug
delivery and amplifying antitumor therapy. Lipophilic AS1411
aptamer-immunoadjuvant CpG fused sequences (Apt-CpG-DSPE) were conjugated to
facilitate decoration onto HDLs; and doxorubicin (Dox) was successively
intercalated into the consecutive base pairs of Apt-CpG to complete immune HDL
nanodrug imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox. For relay drug delivery, imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox underwent 
site-specific structure collapse in tumor intercellular substances inspired from 
HDL biofunctions (sequential module I); subsequently, dissociated Apt-CpG-Dox was
endocytosed into tumor cells mediated by the recognition of AS1411 and nucleolin 
(sequential module II), translocating Dox to nucleus and enabling tumor ablation 
and antigens release. The liberated CpG motif further evoked antigen recognition,
induced vast secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated host
antitumor immunity. Our studies demonstrated that HDL biomimetic platform based
relay drug delivery strategy outperformed the monotherapy counterparts in
malignant tumor models, eventually generating an augmented antitumor efficacy.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the epidemiology of bloodstream infection
(BSI) in oncology patients at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital
(RCWMCH), Cape Town with focus on the commonest causes, complications and
antimicrobial susceptibilities in BSI.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the
haematology-oncology unit of RCWMCH. All positive blood cultures from RCWMCH
oncology patients taken in 2012 to 2014 were retrieved to identify BSI cases.
RESULTS: From 343 positive cultures, 150 BSI episodes were identified amongst 89 
patients; 49.1% of the culture isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 41.6% were
gram-negative bacteria and 9.3% fungal. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus and
Viridans Group Streptococcus were the commonest gram-positive isolates.
Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were the commonest gram-negative
isolates. The majority of BSI episodes occurred in patients with haematological
malignancies (74%), in the presence of severe neutropaenia (76.4%) and was
associated with chemotherapy (88%). Complications occurred in 14% of BSI. Fungal 
infections had the highest prevalence of complications (21.4%). Three children
died during BSI giving a case-fatality rate of 2%.
CONCLUSION: BSI in our patients are mainly caused by gram-positive bacteria and
associated with a low case-fatality rate. These results are consistent with
worldwide experience of BSI in paediatric oncology.

Importance: Localized prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment among elderly men
who are not likely to benefit represents a potential source of low-value health
care services.
Objective: To quantify the costs to the Medicare program associated with
detection and treatment of prostate cancer among elderly men in the United
States.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide, population-based,
retrospective cohort study uses the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify men 70 years or older diagnosed with 
localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2007 and to ascertain Medicare costs
associated with diagnosis and workup, treatment, follow-up, and morbidity
management of the disease. National Medicare costs were estimated using
per-person costs, stage-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates by age from SEER
2007 through 2011, and 2010 Census population estimates by age.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated costs to the Medicare program overall, and 
in each (mutually exclusive) category related to diagnosis and workup, treatment,
follow-up, and morbidity management.
Results: This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study included
49 692 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the SEER-Medicare database
(all participants were 70 years or older; 25 981 [52.3%] were 76 years or older).
The median per-patient cost within 3 years after prostate cancer diagnosis was
$14 453 (interquartile range [IQR], $4887-$27 899). The majority of this cost was
attributable to treatment costs (median, $10 558; IQR, $1990-$23 718). Patients
with a Gleason score of 6 or lower who pursued initial conservative management
(no treatment within 12 months of diagnosis) had a 3-year median total cost of
$1914 per patient. The estimated total 3-year cost to the Medicare program
associated with the annual detection of prostate cancer in men 70 years or older 
is approximately $1.2 billion. Increasing active surveillance use in those with
Gleason score of 6 or lower could reduce this cost by $320 million.
Conclusions and Relevance: There is substantial cost to the Medicare program
associated with the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer among
elderly men in the United States, despite the fact that these men are unlikely to
die of prostate cancer. The majority of costs are related to treatment. Reducing 
provision of low-value health care services among this patient population could
result in significant health care savings.

Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide and the sixth most
common cause of cancer-related death; however, worldwide incidence and mortality 
rates do not reflect the geographic variations in the occurrence of this disease.
In recent years, increased attention has been focused on the high incidence of
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) throughout the eastern corridor of
Africa, extending from Ethiopia to South Africa. Nascent investigations are
underway at a number of sites throughout the region in an effort to improve our
understanding of the etiology behind the high incidence of ESCC in this region.
In 2017, these sites established the African Esophageal Cancer Consortium. Here, 
we summarize the priorities of this newly established consortium: to implement
coordinated multisite investigations into etiology and identify targets for
primary prevention; to address the impact of the clinical burden of ESCC via
capacity building and shared resources in treatment and palliative care; and to
heighten awareness of ESCC among physicians, at-risk populations, policy makers, 
and funding agencies.

PURPOSE: The cost of providing cancer care in low-income countries remains
largely unknown, which creates a significant barrier to effective planning and
resource allocation. This study examines the cost of providing comprehensive
cancer care at the Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence (BCCOE) in Rwanda.
METHODS: A retrospective costing analysis was conducted from the provider
perspective by using secondary data from the administrative systems of the BCCOE.
We identified the start-up funds necessary to begin initial implementation and
determined the fiscal year 2013-2014 operating cost of the cancer program,
including capital expenditures and fixed and variable costs.
RESULTS: A total of $556,105 US dollars was assessed as necessary start-up
funding to implement the program. The annual operating cost of the cancer program
was found to be $957,203 US dollars. Radiotherapy, labor, and chemotherapy were
the most significant cost drivers. Radiotherapy services, which require sending
patients out of country because there are no radiation units in Rwanda, comprised
25% of program costs, labor accounted for 21%, and chemotherapy, supportive
medications, and consumables accounted for 15%. Overhead, training, computed
tomography scans, surgeries, blood products, pathology, and social services
accounted for less than 10% of the total.
CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to examine operating costs for
implementing a cancer center in a low-income country. Having a strong commitment 
to cancer care, adapting clinical protocols to the local setting, shifting tasks,
and creating collaborative partnerships make it possible for BCCOE to provide
quality cancer care at a fraction of the cost seen in middle- and high-income
countries, which has saved many lives and improved survival. Not all therapies,
though, were available because of limited financial resources.

Skinner, Duke University, Durham, NC; and Nicholas A. Othieno-Abinya, University 
of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.

PURPOSE: In response to the increasing cancer burden in Kenya, this study
identified barriers to patients seeking access to cancer testing and treatment
and to clinicians in delivering these services. Policy recommendations based on
findings are presented.
METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured key informant interviews.
Purposive sampling was used to recruit 14 participants: seven oncology clinicians
and seven support and advocacy leaders for patients with cancer. Qualitative
analysis was used to identify themes.
RESULTS: Seven barriers to cancer testing and treatment were identified: high
cost of testing and treatment, low level of knowledge about cancer among
population and clinicians, poor health-seeking behaviors among population, long
distances to access diagnostic and treatment services, lack of decentralized
diagnostic and treatment facilities, poor communication, and lack of better
cancer policy development and implementation.
CONCLUSION: Kenyans seeking cancer services face significant barriers that result
in late presentation, misdiagnosis, interrupted treatment, stigma, and fear. Four
policy recommendations to improve access for patients with cancer are (1) improve
health insurance for patients with cancer; (2) establish testing and treatment
facilities in all counties; (3) acquire diagnosis and treatment equipment and
train health personnel to screen, diagnose, and treat cancer; and (4) increase
public health awareness and education about cancer to improve diagnoses and
treatment. Effective cancer testing and treatment options can be developed to
address cancer in a resource-constrained environment like Kenya. An in-depth look
at effective interventions and policies being implemented in countries facing
similar challenges would provide valuable lessons to Kenya's health sector and
policymakers.

PURPOSE: In 2005, the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program in Zambia (CCPPZ) was
implemented and has since provided cervical cancer screen-and-treat services to
more than 500,000 women. By leveraging the successes and experiences of the
CCPPZ, we intended to build capacity for the early detection and surgical
treatment of breast cancer.
METHODS: Our initiative sought to build capacity for breast cancer care through
the (1) formation of a breast cancer advocacy alliance to raise awareness, (2)
creation of resource-appropriate breast cancer care training curricula for mid-
and high-level providers, and (3) implementation of early detection and treatment
capacity within two major health care facilities.
RESULTS: Six months after the completion of the initiative, the following
outcomes were documented: Breast health education and clinical breast examination
(CBE) services were successfully integrated into the service platforms of four
CCPPZ clinics. Two new breast diagnostic centers were opened, which provided
access to breast ultrasound, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, and needle
aspiration. Breast health education and CBE were provided to 1,955 clients, 167
of whom were evaluated at the two diagnostic centers; 55 of those evaluated
underwent core-needle biopsy, of which 17 were diagnosed with invasive cancer.
Newly trained surgeons performed six sentinel lymph node mappings, eight sentinel
lymph node dissections, and 10 breast conservation surgeries (lumpectomies).
CONCLUSION: This initiative successfully established clinical services in Zambia 
that are critical for the early detection and surgical management of breast
cancer.

The National Cancer Institute-led multidisciplinary Comparative Brain Tumor
Consortium (CBTC) convened a glioma pathology board, comprising both veterinarian
and physician neuropathologists, and conducted a comprehensive review of 193
cases of canine glioma. The immediate goal was to improve existing glioma
classification methods through creation of a histologic atlas of features, thus
yielding greater harmonization of phenotypic characterization. The long-term goal
was to support future incorporation of clinical outcomes and genomic data into
proposed simplified diagnostic schema, so as to further bridge the worlds of
veterinary and physician neuropathology and strengthen validity of the dog as a
naturally occurring, translationally relevant animal model of human glioma. All
cases were morphologically reclassified according to a new schema devised by the 
entire board, yielding a majority opinion diagnosis of astrocytoma (43, 22.3%),
19 of which were low-grade and 24 high-grade, and oligodendroglioma (134, 69.4%),
35 of which were low-grade and 99 were high-grade. Sixteen cases (8.3%) could not
be classified as oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma based on morphology alone and
were designated as undefined gliomas. The simplified classification scheme
proposed herein provides a tractable means for future addition of molecular data,
and also serves to highlight histologic similarities and differences between
human and canine glioma.

Background: Differential use of endocrine therapy (ET) by race may contribute to 
breast cancer outcome disparities, but racial differences in ET behaviors are
poorly understood.
Methods: Women aged 20-74 years with a first primary, stage I-III, hormone
receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer were included. At 2 years postdiagnosis, we
assessed nonadherence, defined as not taking ET every day or missing more than
two pills in the past 14 days, discontinuation, and a composite measure of
underuse, defined as either missing pills or discontinuing completely. Using
logistic regression, we evaluated the relationship between race and nonadherence,
discontinuation, and overall underuse in unadjusted, clinically adjusted, and
socioeconomically adjusted models.
Results: A total of 1280 women were included; 43.2% self-identified as black.
Compared to white women, black women more often reported nonadherence (13.7% vs
5.2%) but not discontinuation (10.0% vs 10.7%). Black women also more often
reported the following: hot flashes, night sweats, breast sensitivity, and joint 
pain; believing that their recurrence risk would not change if they stopped ET;
forgetting to take ET; and cost-related barriers. In multivariable analysis,
black race remained statistically significantly associated with nonadherence
after adjusting for clinical characteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.72, 95%
confidence interval = 1.75 to 4.24) and after adding socioeconomic to clinical
characteristics (adjusted odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval = 1.50 to
3.97) but was not independently associated with discontinuation after adjustment.
Low recurrence risk perception and lack of a shared decision making were strongly
predictive of ET underuse across races.
Conclusions: Our results highlight important racial differences in ET-adherence
behaviors, perceptions of benefits/harms, and shared decision making that may be 
targeted with culturally tailored interventions.

The SIU (Société Internationale d'Urologie)-ICUD (International Consultation on
Urologic Diseases) working group on systemic therapy for metastatic bladder
cancer has summarized the most recent findings on the aforementioned topic and
came to conclusions and recommendations according to the evidence published. In
Europe and the United States, treatment for metastatic UC has changed a great
deal recently, mainly involving a move from chemotherapy to immune checkpoint
blockers. This is particularly true in platinum-refractory disease, where
supportive randomized data exist. Five checkpoint blockers have been approved in 
this setting by the FDA: avelumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and
pembrolizumab. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab have been approved in
Europe.

Patients experiencing a terminal drug related event reflect a sentinel event. If 
this pharmacotherapy is a widely used agent, it may be viewed as a catastrophic
problem. If patients are dying from illegal drug use when the medical
establishment fails them by withdrawing or minimizing their medically prescribed 
medication, then the burden rests with their health care providers, legislation, 
and insurance carriers to actively participate in a collegial fashion to achieve 
parity. Causing a decay in functionality in previously functional patients, may
occur with appropriately prescribed opioid medications addressing non-cancer pain
when withdrawing or diminishing either with or without patient consent. The
members of the medical profession have diminished their prescribing of opioids
for their patients out of apparent fear of reprisal, state or federal government 
sanctions, and other concerned groups. Diminishing former dosages or deleting the
opioid medication, preferably in concert with the patient, often results in
inequitable patient care. Enforcing sanctioned decreases or ceasing to prescribe 
from their former required/established opioid medications precipitate patient
discord. In absence of opioid misuse, abuse, diversion or addiction based upon
medical "guidelines" and with a poor foundation of Evidence Based Medicine the
CDC guidelines, it may be masked as a true guideline reflecting a decrement of
clinical judgment, wisdom, and compassion. This article also discusses the role
of pharmacy chains, insurance carriers, and their pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs) contribution to this multidimensional problem. There may be a potential
solution, identified in this paper, if all the associated political, medical and 
insurance groups work cohesively to improve patient care. This article and the
CDC guidelines are not focused at hospice, palliative, end of life care pain
management.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) adoption was associated with a decrease in screening
mammography capacity across Breast Cancer Screening Consortium facilities, given 
concerns about increasing imaging and interpretation times associated with DBT.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Facility characteristics and examination volume data were
collected prospectively from Breast Cancer Screening Consortium facilities that
adopted DBT between 2011 and 2014. Interrupted time series analyses using Poisson
regression models in which facility was considered a random effect were used to
evaluate differences between monthly screening volumes during the 12-month
preadoption period and the 12-month postadoption period (with the two periods
separated by a 3-month lag) and to test for changes in month-to-month
facility-level screening volume during the preadoption and postadoption periods.
RESULTS: Across five regional breast imaging registries, 15 of 83 facilities
(18.1%) adopted DBT for screening between 2011 and 2014. Most had no academic
affiliation (73.3% [11/15]), were nonprofit (80.0% [12/15]), and were general
radiology practices (66.7% [10/15]). Facility-level monthly screening volumes
were slightly higher during the postadoption versus preadoption periods (relative
risk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11). Monthly screening volumes remained
relatively stable within the preadoption period (RR, 1.00 per month; 95% CI
1.00-1.01 per month) and the postadoption period (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01 per
month).
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of facilities with varied characteristics, monthly
screening examination volumes did not decrease after DBT adoption.

The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, implemented in 2006, increased managed
care options for seniors. It introduced insurance plans for prescription drug
coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries, whether they were enrolled in FFS or
managed care (Medicare Advantage) plans. The availability of drug coverage
beginning in 2006 served to free up budgets for FFS Medicare enrollees that could
be used to make copayments for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using endoscopy 
(colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy). In 2007, Medicare eliminated the copayments
required by seniors for CRC screening by endoscopy. Later in 2008, CRC screening 
by colonoscopy became part of the gold standard for CRC screening. This
legitimized its use and offered even further encouragement to seniors, who may
have been reluctant to undergo the procedure because of the non-pecuniary risks
associated with it. In addition, 37 CRC screening interventions occurred during
this timeframe to enhance compliance with screening standards. Using multilevel
analysis of individuals' endoscopy utilization, derived from 100% FFS Medicare
claims, along with county-level market and contextual factors, we compare the
periods before and after the MMA (2001-2005 to 2006-2009) to determine whether
disparities in the utilization of endoscopic CRC screening occurred or changed
over the decade. We examined Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics relative to Whites,
and Females relative to Males (with race or ethnicity combined). We examined each
state separately for evidence of disparities within states, to avoid confounding 
by geographic disparities. We expected that the net effect of the policy changes 
and the targeted interventions over the decade would be to increase CRC screening
by endoscopy, reducing disparities. We saw improvements over time (reduced
disparities relative to Whites) for Blacks and Hispanics residing in several
states, and improvements over time for Females relative to Males in many states. 
For the vast majority of states, however, disparities persisted with Whites and
Males exhibiting greater rates of utilization than other groups. States that
undertook the interventions were more likely to have had improvements in
disparities or positive disparities for women and minorities. While some gains
were made over this time period, the gains were unevenly distributed across the
USA and more work needs to be done to reduce remaining disparities.

Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare but
extremely lethal malignancy that mainly impacts young women. SCCOHT is
characterized by a diploid genome with loss of SMARCA4 and lack of SMARCA2
expression, two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling
complex. We and others have identified the histone methyltransferase EZH2 as a
promising therapeutic target for SCCOHT, suggesting that SCCOHT cells depend on
the alternation of epigenetic pathways for survival. In this study, we found that
SCCOHT cells were more sensitive to pan-HDAC inhibitors compared to other ovarian
cancer lines or immortalized cell lines tested. Pan-HDAC inhibitors, such as
quisinostat, reversed the expression of a group of proteins that were deregulated
in SCCOHT cells due to SMARCA4 loss, leading to growth arrest, apoptosis and
differentiation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth of xenografted tumors of
SCCOHT cells. Moreover, combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors and EZH2 inhibitors
at sub-lethal doses synergistically induced histone H3K27 acetylation and target 
gene expression, leading to rapid induction of apoptosis and growth suppression
of SCCOHT cells and xenografted tumors. Therefore, our preclinical study
highlighted the therapeutic potential of combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors
with EZH2 catalytic inhibitors to treat SCCOHT.

BACKGROUND: Although social exposures have complex and dynamic relationships and 
interactions, the existing literature on the impact of rural-urban residence on
stage at breast cancer diagnosis does not examine heterogeneity of effect. We
examined the joint effect of social support, social relationship strain, and
rural-urban residence on stage at breast cancer diagnosis.
METHODS: Using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) (n = 161,808), we
describe the distribution of social, behavioral, and clinical factors by
rural-urban residence among postmenopausal women with incident breast cancer
(n = 7,120). We used rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes to categorize
baseline residential addresses as urban, large rural city/town, or small rural
town, and the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results staging system to
categorize breast cancer stage at diagnosis (dichotomized as early or late). We
then used univariable and multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds
ratios (ORs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the
relationship between rural-urban residence and stage at breast cancer diagnosis. 
We included separate interaction terms between rural-urban residence and social
strain and social support to test for statistical interaction.
RESULTS: Of the social, behavioral, and clinical factors we examined, only
younger age at WHI enrollment screening was significantly associated with late
stage at breast cancer diagnosis (p = 0.003). Contrary to our hypothesis,
rural-urban residence was not significantly associated with stage at breast
cancer diagnosis among postmenopausal women ([adjusted OR, 95% CI] for urban
compared with small town: 1.08 [0.76-1.53]; large town compared with small town: 
1.16 [0.74-1.84]; and urban compared with large town: 0.93 [0.68-1.26]).The
associations did not vary by social support or social strain (p for interaction
between RUCA and social strain and social support, respectively: 0.99 and 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should examine other potential effect modifiers to
identify novel factors predictive or protective for late stage at breast cancer
diagnosis associated with rural-urban residence.

Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) are key physiologic
suppressors of the cytotoxic immune reaction. However, to date, the combination
of PD1/PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and
antigen-presenting cells has been only minimally reported in breast carcinoma, in
particular in relation to HER2-positive cases. The goal of this study was to
evaluate both cellular tumoral immune reaction and PD-L1/PD1 distribution in
HER2-positive cases, as well as any associations with clinical outcome using
conventional chemotherapy combined with HER2 blocking. Multicolor
immunohistochemical multiplex assays simultaneously demonstrating PD1, PD-L1, and
CD8 or PD-L1, CD3, and CD163 were performed on tissue microarrays (TMA)
representing 216 pretreatment cases of HER2-positive invasive breast carcinoma.
PD-L1 expression was identified in 38 cases (18%), including 12 cases (6%) with
PD-L1 labeling of tumor cells and 26 cases (12%) with PD-L1 labeling of immune
cells only. Ten of 12 cases with PD-L1 staining of tumor cells showed staining of
associated immune cells as well. With this assay method, PD1 was detectable in
many fewer cases (6 cases or 3%). PD-L1 expression was positively associated with
high Nottingham grade, negative ER and PR, the absence of lymph node metastasis, 
and high levels of CD8+ cells. The overall survival by univariate analysis was
positively associated with lower tumor stage, the absence of lymph node
metastasis, PD-L1 expression, and high levels of CD8+ cells. Therefore, our data 
suggest cytotoxic immune reaction mediated by CD8-positive T cells and PD-L1
expression may predict a better outcome in patients with HER2-positive breast
carcinoma managed with conventional chemotherapy and HER2-blocking therapy. These
findings recommend clinical trials utilizing checkpoint blocking immunotherapy in
some form for HER2-positive breast cancer.

Breast cancer remains a leading cause of death for women throughout the world.
Recent advances in medical imaging technologies and tumor targeting agents
signify vast potential for progress toward improved management of this global
problem. Phase-change contrast agents (PCCAs) are dynamic imaging agents with
practical applications in both the research and clinical settings. PCCAs possess 
characteristics that allow for cellular uptake where they can be converted from
liquid-phase PCCAs to gaseous microbubbles via ultrasound energy. Previously, we 
reported successful internalization of folate-targeted PCCAs in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells followed by ultrasound-mediated activation to produce internalized
microbubbles. This study examines the binding, internalization and activation of 
folate-receptor targeted PCCAs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as a function of
gaseous core compositions, incubation time and ultrasound exposure period. In
vitro results indicate that internalization and ultrasound-mediated activation of
PCCAs were significantly greater using a 50:50 mixture of
decafluorobutane:dodecafluoropentane compared with other core compositions: 50:50
octafluoropropane:decafluorobutane (p < 0.0001), decafluorobutane (p < 0.04) and 
dodecafluoropentane (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, it was found that PCCAs composed
of perfluorocarbons with higher boiling points responded with greater activation 
efficiency when exposed to 12s of ultrasound exposure as opposed to 4s of
ultrasound exposure. When evaluating different incubation times, it was found
that incubating the PCCAs with breast cancer cells for 60min did not produce
significantly greater internalization and activation compared with incubation for
10 min; this was concluded after comparing the number of microbubbles present per
cell before ultrasound versus post-ultrasound, and finding a ratio of
intracellular microbubbles post-ultrasound/pre-ultrasound, 3.46 versus 3.14,
respectively. The data collected in this study helps illustrate further
optimization of folate-receptor targeted PCCAs for breast cancer targeting and
imaging.

Cancer cells are able to avoid immune surveillance and exploit the immune system 
to grow and metastasize. With the development of nano- and micro-particles, there
has been a growing number of immunotherapy delivery systems developed to elicit
innate and adaptive immune responses to eradicate cancer cells. This can be
accomplished by training resident immune cells to recognize and eliminate cells
with tumor-associated antigens or by providing external stimuli to enhance tumor 
cell apoptosis in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this
review we will focus on nano- and micro-particle (NP and MP) based
immunotherapies and vaccines used to elicit a potent and sustained antitumor
immune response.

The safety and efficacy of anticancer antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) depend on
the selection of tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb), linker, and drug, as 
well as their specific chemical arrangement and linkage chemistry. In this study,
we used a heterobifunctional cross-linker to conjugate docetaxel (DX) to
cetuximab (CET) or panitumumab (PAN). The resulting ADCs were investigated for
their in vitro EGFR-specific cytotoxicity and in vivo anticancer activity.
Reaction conditions, such as reducing agent, time, temperature, and alkylation
buffer, were optimized to yield potent and stable ADCs with consistent
batch-to-batch drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs). ADCs were synthesized with DARs
from 0.4 to 3.0, and all retained their EGFR affinity and specificity after
modification. ADCs were sensitive to cell surface wildtype EGFR expression,
demonstrating more cytotoxicity in EGFR-expressing A431 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines
compared to U87MG cells. A431 tumor-bearing mice treated once weekly for four
weeks with 100 mg/kg cetuximab-docetaxel ADC (C-SC-DX, DAR 2.5) showed durable
anticancer responses and improved overall survival compared to the same treatment
regimen with 1 mg/kg DX, 100 mg/kg CET, or a combination 1 mg/kg DX and 100 mg/kg
CET. New treatment options are emerging for patients with both wild-type and
mutated EGFR-overexpressing cancers, and these studies highlight the potential
role of EGFR-targeted ADC therapies as a promising new treatment option.

The health risks associated with acute and prolonged exposure to estrogen
receptor (ER) modulators has led to a concerted effort to identify and prioritize
potential disruptors present in the environment. ER agonists and antagonists are 
identified with end-point assays, quantifying changes in cellular proliferation
or gene transactivation in monolayers of estrogen receptor alpha expressing (ER+)
cells upon exposure. While these monolayer cultures can be prepared, dosed, and
analyzed in a highly parallelized manner, they are unable to predict the
potencies of ER modulators in vivo accurately. Physiologically relevant model
systems that better predict tissue- or organ-level responses are needed. To
address this need, we describe here a screening platform capable of
quantitatively assessing ER modulators in 96 chemically isolated 3D cultures.
These cultures are supported in wax-patterned paper scaffolds whose design has
improved performance and throughput over previously described paper-based setups.
To highlight the potential of paper-based cultures for toxicity screens, we
measured the potency of known ER modulators with a luciferase-based reporter
assay. We also quantified the proliferation and invasion of two ER+ cell lines in
the presence of estradiol. Despite the inability of the current setup to better
predict in vivo potencies of ER modulators than monolayer cultures, the results
demonstrate the potential of this platform to support increasingly complex and
physiologically relevant tissue-like structures for environmental chemical risk
assessment.

While primarily studied for their roles in innate immune response, the IκB kinase
(IKK)-related kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKε also promote the
oncogenic phenotype in a variety of cancers. Additionally, several substrates of 
these kinases control proliferation, autophagy, cell survival, and cancer immune 
responses. Here we review the involvement of TBK1 and IKKε in controlling
different cancers and in regulating responses to cancer immunotherapy.

PURPOSE: The ability to predict and detect clinical and subclinical
nephrotoxicity early in the course of therapy has the potential to improve
long-term outcomes in cancer patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.
Pharmacokinetic parameters could serve as predictors of cisplatin-induced
nephrotoxicity.
METHODS: Participants [n = 13] were treated with a 1-h cisplatin infusion
[30-75 mg/m2]. Blood was collected pre-dose and up to 6 h post-dose. Urinary
biomarkers [KIM-1, calbindin, clusterin, GST-pi, β2M, albumin, NGAL, osteopontin,
clusterin, MCP-1, cystatin C, and TFF3] were measured at baseline, days 3 and 10.
Total and unbound platinum concentrations were measured using ICP/MS.
Noncompartmental analysis was performed, and correlation and regression analyses 
evaluated the relationships between platinum pharmacokinetics and nephrotoxicity.
RESULTS: Peak platinum urinary concentrations correlated with urinary levels of
KIM-1, calbindin, clusterin, GST-pi, β2M, albumin, NGAL, osteopontin, clusterin, 
cystatin C, and TFF3 at day 10. Unbound platinum plasma concentrations at 2 h
also correlated with urinary clusterin, β2M, cystatin C, NGAL, osteopontin, and
TFF3 at day 3. Regression analyses suggested 2-h total plasma platinum
concentrations greater than 2000 ng/ml, and peak urinary platinum concentrations 
above 24,000 ng/ml may serve as potential approximations for elevated risk of
nephrotoxicity. Platinum area under the plasma concentration time curve was
associated with serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Peak plasma and urinary platinum concentrations and pharmacokinetic 
parameters were associated with risk of subclinical cisplatin-induced kidney
injury as assessed using novel urinary biomarkers. Future studies will examine
these relationships in larger clinical populations of cisplatin-induced acute
kidney injury.

HPV vaccination rates in Florida are low. To increase rates, the CDC recommends
clinics adhere to components of their evidence-based quality improvement program,
AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange of information). We explored
factors associated with engaging in HPV-specific AFIX-related activities. In
2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 770
pediatric and family medicine physicians in Florida and assessed vaccination
practices, clinic characteristics, and HPV-related knowledge. Data were analyzed 
in 2017. The primary outcome was whether physicians' clinics engaged in ≥1 AFIX
activity. We stratified by physician specialty and developed multivariable models
using a backward selection approach. Of the participants in the analytic sample
(n = 340), 52% were male, 60% were White of any ethnicity, and 55% were
non-Hispanic. Pediatricians and family medicine physicians differed on: years
practicing medicine (p < 0.001), HPV-related knowledge (p < 0.001), and VFC
provider status (p < 0.001), among others. Only 39% of physicians reported
engaging in ≥1 AFIX activity. In the stratified multivariable model for
pediatricians, AFIX activity was significantly associated with HPV-related
knowledge (aOR = 1.33;95%CI = 1.08-1.63) and provider use of vaccine reminder
prompts (aOR = 3.61;95%CI = 1.02-12.77). For family medicine physicians,
HPV-related knowledge was significant (aOR = 1.57;95%CI = 1.20-2.05) as was
majority race of patient population (non-Hispanic White vs. Other:
aOR = 3.02;95%CI = 1.08-8.43), daily patient load (<20 vs. 20-24:
aOR = 9.05;95%CI = 2.72-30.10), and vaccine administration to male patients
(aOR = 2.98;95%CI = 1.11-8.02). Fewer than half of Florida pediatric and family
medicine physicians engaged in any AFIX activities. Future interventions to
increase AFIX engagement should focus on implementing and evaluating AFIX
activities in groups identified as having low engagement in AFIX activities.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) and
α-blockers among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in relation to
prostate cancer (PCa) incidence, severity and mortality.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective 20-year cohort study in men residing in
Saskatchewan, aged 40-89 years, with a BPH-coded medical claim between 1995 and
2014, was conducted. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare
incidence of PCa diagnosis, metastatic PCa, Gleason score 8-10 PCa, and PCa
mortality among 5ARI users (n = 4 571), α-blocker users (n = 7 764) and non-users
(n = 11 677).
RESULTS: In comparison with both non-users and α-blocker users, 5ARI users had a 
~40% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis (11.0% and 11.4% vs 5.8%, respectively), and
α-blocker users had an 11% lower risk of a PCa diagnosis compared with non-users.
Overall, the incidence of metastatic PCa and PCa mortality was not significantly 
different among 5ARI or α-blocker users compared with non-users (adjusted hazard 
ratios [HR] of metastatic PCa: 1.12 and 1.13, respectively, and PCa mortality:
1.11 and 1.18, respectively, P > 0.05 for both drugs), but both 5ARI and
a-blocker users had ~30% higher risk of Gleason score 8-10 cancer, adjusted HR
1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.82, P = 0.03, and adjusted HR 1.28, 95%
CI 1.03-1.59, P = 0.02, respectively compared with non-users.
CONCLUSION: The use of 5ARIs was associated with lower risk of PCa diagnosis,
regardless of comparison group. Risk of high grade PCa was higher among both 5ARI
users and α-blocker users compared with non-users; however, this did not
translate into higher risk of PCa mortality.

BACKGROUND: In the SPARTAN trial, addition of apalutamide to androgen deprivation
therapy, as compared with placebo plus androgen deprivation therapy,
significantly improved metastasis-free survival in men with non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for development of
metastases. We aimed to investigate the effects of apalutamide versus placebo
added to androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
METHODS: SPARTAN is a multicentre, international, randomised, phase 3 trial.
Participants were aged 18 years or older, with non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen doubling time
of 10 months or less, and a prostate-specific antigen concentration of 2 ng/mL or
more in serum. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to 240 mg oral apalutamide
per day plus androgen deprivation therapy, or matched oral placebo plus androgen 
deprivation therapy, using an interactive voice randomisation system. Permuted
block randomisation was used according to the three baseline stratification
factors: prostate-specific antigen doubling time (>6 months vs ≤6 months), use of
bone-sparing drugs (yes vs no), and presence of local-regional nodal disease (N0 
vs N1). Each treatment cycle was 28 days. The primary endpoint was
metastasis-free survival. The trial was unblinded in July, 2017. In this
prespecified exploratory analysis we assessed HRQOL using the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires, which
we collected at baseline, day 1 of cycle 1 (before dose), day 1 of treatment
cycles 1-6, day 1 of every two cycles from cycles 7 to 13, and day 1 of every
four cycles thereafter. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT01946204.
FINDINGS: Between Oct 14, 2013, and Dec 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 1207
patients to receive apalutamide (n=806) or placebo (n=401). The clinical cutoff
date, as for the primary analysis, was May 19, 2017. Median follow-up for overall
survival was 20·3 months (IQR 14·8-26·6). FACT-P total and subscale scores were
associated with a preservation of HRQOL from baseline to cycle 29 in the
apalutamide group; there were similar results for EQ-5D-3L. At baseline, the mean
for FACT-P total score in both the apalutamide and placebo groups were consistent
with the FACT-P general population norm for US adult men. Group mean
patient-reported outcome scores over time show that HRQOL was maintained from
baseline after initiation of apalutamide treatment and was similar over time
among patients receiving apalutamide versus placebo. Least-squares mean change
from baseline shows that HRQOL deterioration was more apparent in the placebo
group.
INTERPRETATION: In asymptomatic men with high-risk non-metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer, HRQOL was maintained after initiation of
apalutamide treatment. Considered with findings from SPARTAN, patients who
received apalutamide had longer metastasis-free survival and longer time to
symptomatic progression than did those who received placebo, while preserving
HRQOL.

This article begins by introducing the historical background surrounding the
volume-outcomes relationship literature, particularly in complex cancer surgery. 
The state of evidence surrounding mortality, as well as other outcomes, in
relation to both hospital and surgeon procedure volume is synthesized. Where it
is understood, the level of adoption of regionalization of various complex
surgeries in the United States is also presented. Various controversies are
weighed and discussed. Finally, various models of regionalization and proposed
alternatives to regionalization from the peer-reviewed literature are presented.

human malignancies, the endothelial cell cancer Kaposi's sarcoma, and two B cell 
cancers, Primary Effusion Lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. KSHV has
latent and lytic phases of the viral life cycle, and while both contribute to
viral pathogenesis, lytic proteins contribute to KSHV-mediated oncogenesis.
Reactivation from latency is driven by the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA,
and RTA transcription is controlled by epigenetic modifications. To identify host
chromatin-modifying proteins that are involved in the latent to lytic transition,
we screened a panel of inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins for 
their ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. We found several novel regulators
of viral reactivation: an inhibitor of Bmi1, PTC-209, two additional histone
deacetylase inhibitors, Romidepsin and Panobinostat, and the bromodomain
inhibitor (+)-JQ1. All of these compounds stimulate lytic gene expression, viral 
genome replication, and release of infectious virions. Treatment with Romidepsin,
Panobinostat, and PTC-209 induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter, and 
results in nucleosome depletion at this locus. Finally, silencing Bmi1 induces
KSHV reactivation, indicating that Bmi1, a member of the Polycomb repressive
complex 1, is critical for maintaining KSHV latency.

Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) represents an aggressive histologic subtype of
endometrial cancer. It is associated with a poor prognosis, and improved
therapies for women battling USCs are greatly needed. ONC201 is an orally
bioavailable, first-in-class small molecule that induces tumor necrosis
factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) independent of p53. ONC201 has
demonstrated anti-tumorigenic activity in pre-clinical models of solid tumors
through induction of apoptosis and inactivation of the AKT/MAPK pathways. Recent 
phase I and II clinical trials have shown that ONC201 is well tolerated and may
have single agent activity in high grade glioma patients among others. We sought 
to determine the effects of ONC201 on cell proliferation in USC and identify the 
mechanisms by which ONC201 inhibits cell growth in this disease. ONC201 inhibited
cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in ARK1, ARK2 and SPEC-2 cell
lines. The anti-proliferative activity of ONC201 in ARK1 and SPEC-2 cells was
associated with induction apoptosis independent of p53 via both a TRAIL mediated 
apoptotic pathway and a mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Treatment with ONC201
resulted in significant reduction in adhesion and invasion as well as inhibition 
of the AKT and MAPK pathways. In addition, ONC201 markedly potentiated the
anti-tumorigenic effects of paclitaxel in USC cells. Our results suggest that
ONC201 has significant anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects in USC
cells through both induction of apoptosis and inhibition of the AKT and MAPK
pathways. ONC201 and paclitaxel are a promising therapeutic combination in USC
cells. Thus, ONC201 should be evaluated as a single agent and as a therapeutic
partner with paclitaxel in future clinical trials of USC.

Objective: Oncolytic immunotherapy involves the use of viruses to target and
destroy cancer cells and to induce immune responses for an enhanced antitumor
effect. Talimogene laherparepvec, a genetically modified herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) that selectively replicates in tumors to induce lytic cell death, 
tumor antigen release, and the local production of granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), has been approved for the treatment of a
defined population of patients with metastatic melanoma. Talimogene laherparepvec
is administered as a series of intralesional injections, and specific procedures 
are implemented to minimize the risk of viral exposure. Because talimogene
laherparepvec represents a novel therapeutic modality, its preparation,
administration, and handling requirements differ from current therapies;
pharmacists have an important role in developing new procedures to incorporate it
into clinical practice. Methods: In this review, pharmacists with experience
dispensing talimogene laherparepvec, in the clinical trial setting and/or as a
commercially available product at US academic institutions, synthesized their
personal experiences through group discussions to provide insights on the
ordering, receipt, storage, preparation, administration, and handling of
talimogene laherparepvec. Results: Suggestions for patient education and
practical guidance to assist hospital pharmacists and decision makers with
implementing talimogene laherparepvec at their institutions are provided.
Conclusion: These insights may further inform the development of policies or
procedures to incorporate talimogene laherparepvec into clinical settings and
improve patient outcomes.

Chronic inflammation in the colorectum, a significant contributor to colorectal
carcinogenesis, can be triggered by the activation of proinflammatory signaling
pathways such as those initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) and nuclear factor 
κB (NF-κB). Although experimental evidence supports calcium and vitamin D
potentially modifying these proinflammatory pathways in the colorectum, human
data in these regards are scarce. We investigated supplemental calcium (1,200 mg 
daily) and/or vitamin D3 (1,000 IU daily) effects on inflammatory signaling
pathway-related biomarkers in a subset of 105 participants from a colorectal
adenoma recurrence chemoprevention clinical trial. We assessed expression of TLR4
and TLR5, which recognize the bacterial components lipopolysaccharides and
flagellin, respectively, and phospho-IKKα/β (pIKKα/β), a biomarker of
inflammation, in the normal-appearing rectal crypt epithelium and stroma using
standardized, automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis.
Following 1 year of treatment, TLR4, TLR5, and pIKKα/β expression in the rectal
mucosa did not statistically significantly change with vitamin D or calcium
supplementation, taken alone or in combination. Several baseline participant
characteristics, including body mass index, history of sessile serrated adenomas,
high red/processed meat intake, and high levels of rectal epithelial cell
proliferation (as measured by MIB-1/Ki-67), were associated with higher baseline 
expression of TLRs or pIKKα/β. Our findings suggest that vitamin D and calcium
may have no substantial effect on the investigated biomarkers. However, several
modifiable lifestyle factors may be associated with TLRs and pIKKα/β expression
in the normal rectal mucosa, supporting their future investigation as potentially
treatable, preneoplastic risk factors for colorectal neoplasms. Cancer Prev Res;

Although anti-PD-1 therapy has improved clinical outcomes for select patients
with advanced cancer, many patients exhibit either primary or adaptive resistance
to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. The role of the tumor stroma in the
development of these mechanisms of resistance to checkpoint inhibitors remains
unclear. We demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of the TGFβ signaling
pathway synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy but
failed to augment anti-PD-1/PD-L1 responses in an autochthonous model of
BRAFV600E melanoma. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that TGFβ pathway
inhibition promoted the proliferative expansion of stromal fibroblasts, thereby
facilitating MMP-9-dependent cleavage of PD-L1 surface expression, leading to
anti-PD-1 resistance in this model. Further work demonstrated that melanomas
escaping anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype associated with
enhanced TGFβ signaling activity. Delayed TGFβ inhibitor therapy, following
anti-PD-1 escape, better served to control further disease progression and was
superior to a continuous combination of anti-PD-1 and TGFβ inhibition. This work 
illustrates that formulating immunotherapy combination regimens to enhance the
efficacy of checkpoint blockade requires an in-depth understanding of the impact 
of these agents on the tumor microenvironment. These data indicated that stromal 
fibroblast MMP-9 may desensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 and suggests that TGFβ
inhibition may generate greater immunologic efficacy when administered following 
the development of acquired anti-PD-1 resistance. Cancer Immunol Res; 1-13. ©2018

OBJECTIVES: The Mental Health Index (MHI) is widely used as a measure of mental
health status, but has not been evaluated in the geriatric oncology population.
This study evaluated the MHI-17 in a geriatric oncology population, to establish 
validity and scoring rules.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Carolina Senior Registry (NCT01137825) was used to
obtain data for 686 patients with cancer 65 and older who completed the MHI-17.
The 17-item patient-reported measure produces one total score summing across four
domains: anxiety, depression, positive affect, and sense of belonging. Cronbach's
alpha (α), confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), item-response theory (IRT)
analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses were used to evaluate 
internal consistency and validity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The revised MHI retained the 13 best-fitting items from
the MHI-17 and resulted in a final model that included two subscales: anxiety
(four items, RMSEA 0.11; CFI 0.99; TLI 0.98) and depression (9 items, RMSEA 0.10;
CFI 0.96; TL 0.95). IRT analyses of the four anxiety items indicated good fit
(RMSEA 0.08) and precise measurement of adults with poor mental health, and the
nine depression items also fit well (RMSEA 0.05). No meaningful differences were 
found by sex, education, or treatment stage. Scores were developed to provide
meaningful norms. The new MHI-13 is a shorter, more accurate way to assess mental
health in older adults with cancer and most importantly allows clinicians to
separately identify anxiety and/or depression - a clinically important
distinction as treatment differs among these two types of mental health
impairment.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the effectiveness of community, workplace, and health
care system–based programs and policies aimed at supporting and promoting
breastfeeding and determine the association between breastfeeding and maternal
health.
DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed®/MEDLINE®, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL®
from January 1, 1980, to October 12, 2017, for studies relevant to the
effectiveness of health care system–based, workplace, and community breastfeeding
programs and policies. For evidence on breastfeeding and maternal health, we
updated the 2007 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report on this topic 
and searched the same databases from November 1, 2005, to October 12, 2017. For
studies of breastfeeding programs and policies, trials, systematic reviews, and
observational studies with a control group were eligible; we excluded primary
care–based programs delivered as part of routine care. For studies related to
breastfeeding and maternal health, we included systematic reviews, case-control
studies, and cohort studies.
REVIEW METHODS: Pairs of reviewers independently selected, extracted data from,
and rated the risk of bias of relevant studies; they graded the strength of
evidence (SOE) using established criteria. We synthesized all evidence
qualitatively.
RESULTS: We included 128 studies (137 publications) and 10 systematic reviews. Of
these, 40 individual studies were relevant to the effectiveness of breastfeeding 
programs or policies, and the remainder were relevant to one or more maternal
health outcomes. Based on evidence from one large randomized controlled trial
(RCT) (Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial [PROBIT], N=17,046)
enrolling mothers who intended to breastfeed and nine cohort studies (1,227,182
women), we graded the SOE for the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) as
moderate for improving rates of breastfeeding duration. Evidence from eight
cohort studies of BFHI (135,983 women) also demonstrates improved rates of
breastfeeding initiation (low SOE). Low SOE (k=4 studies; 1,532 women) supports
the conclusion that health care education or training of staff alone (without
additional breastfeeding support services) does not improve breastfeeding
initiation rates. Women, Infants and Children (WIC, a Federal supplemental
nutrition program) interventions that focus on peer support are effective in
improving rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration (low SOE). We found
limited evidence for other (community-based) interventions and no comparative
studies on workplace or school-based interventions or harms associated with
interventions. For maternal health outcomes, low SOE supports the conclusion that
ever breastfeeding or breastfeeding for longer durations may be associated with
lower rates of breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, hypertension, and type 2
diabetes, but not fractures. Because of heterogeneity and inconsistent results,
we found insufficient evidence on whether breastfeeding is associated with
postpartum depression, cardiovascular disease, or postpartum weight change.
CONCLUSIONS: The body of evidence for breastfeeding programs and policies was
diverse in terms of interventions and settings. Current evidence supports the
benefit of BFHI for improving rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration;
however, evidence from one large RCT (PROBIT) has limited applicability, and
observational studies do not clearly establish the magnitude of benefit. For
women enrolled in WIC, low SOE supports peer-support interventions for improving 
breastfeeding outcomes. The identified associations between breastfeeding and
improved maternal health outcomes are supported by evidence from observational
studies, which cannot determine cause-and-effect relationships.

Purpose The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient-Reported Outcomes version 
of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) was developed
to enable patient reporting of symptomatic adverse events in oncology clinical
research. This study was designed to assess the feasibility and resource
requirements associated with implementing PRO-CTCAE in a multicenter trial.
Methods Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer enrolled in the National
Cancer Institute-sponsored North Central Cancer Treatment Group (Alliance)
Preoperative Radiation or Selective Preoperative Radiation and Evaluation before 
Chemotherapy and Total Mesorectal Excision trial were asked to self-report 30
PRO-CTCAE items weekly from home during preoperative therapy, and every 6 months 
after surgery, via either the Web or an automated telephone system. If
participants did not self-report within 3 days, a central coordinator called them
to complete the items. Compliance was defined as the proportion of participants
who completed PRO-CTCAE assessments at expected time points. Results The
prespecified PRO-CTCAE analysis was conducted after the 500th patient completed
the 6-month follow-up (median age, 56 years; 33% female; 12% nonwhite; 43% high
school education or less; 5% Spanish speaking), across 165 sites. PRO-CTCAE was
reported by participants at 4,491 of 4,882 expected preoperative time points
(92.0% compliance), of which 3,771 (77.2%) were self-reported by participants and
720 (14.7%) were collected via central coordinator backup. Compliance at 6-month 
post-treatment follow-up was 333 of 468 (71.2%), with 122 (26.1%) via backup.
Site research associates spent a median of 15 minutes on PRO-CTCAE work for each 
patient visit. Work by a central coordinator required a 50% time commitment.
Conclusion Home-based reporting of PRO-CTCAE in a multicenter trial is feasible, 
with high patient compliance and low site administrative requirements. PRO-CTCAE 
data capture is improved through centralized backup calls.

PURPOSE: Patients and their families utilize online resources when dealing with a
diagnosis of bladder cancer. Many patients have questions regarding clinical
management options. Online research forums may help researchers and providers
identify research areas of interest. Our objective was to review online forums
and identify research questions that are important to patients and families
impacted by bladder cancer diagnosis.
METHODS: We reviewed 1 month of online content from the Bladder Cancer Advocacy
Network Inspire online community (
https://www.inspire.com/groups/bladder-cancer-advocacy-network ). Using affinity 
diagramming, we categorized the submitted content from patient users into themes 
stratified by the cancer severity of the patient user (non-muscle-invasive
bladder cancer, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, metastatic bladder cancer). We
categorized the content by the audience of forum posts (i.e., inwardly directed, 
those seeking support, vs. outwardly directed, those sharing personal
experiences) and constructed comparative effectiveness research questions from
the submitted content.
RESULTS: From 14 July 2014 to 14 August 2014, a total of 394 forum posts were
collected, of which 3 were excluded from analysis due to non-relevant content,
leaving 391 comments for final analysis. Almost 38% of posts involved
muscle-invasive bladder cancer and 25% of posts were from people other than the
patient. Inwardly and outwardly directed posts were commonly related to clinical 
treatment concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Review of online patient-generated content may offer insight into
comparative effectiveness research topics of importance to bladder cancer
patients. A more formalized process may better represent research priorities
among bladder cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Toxic metals show evidence of carcinogenic and estrogenic properties.
However, little is known about the relationship between airborne metals and
breast cancer. We evaluated the risk of breast cancer in relation to exposure to 
toxic metallic substances in air, individually and combined, in a U.S. wide
cohort.
METHODS: We recruited Sister Study participants (n=50,884), breast cancer-free
women who had a sister with breast cancer, from 2003-2009. The 2005 Environmental
Protection Agency National Air Toxic Assessment's census-tract estimates of metal
concentrations in air (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead,
manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium) were matched to participants'
enrollment residence. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between 
quintiles of individual metals and breast cancer incidence and weighted quantile 
sum regression to model the association between the metal mixture and breast
cancer.
RESULTS: 2,587 breast cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up (mean=7.4
years). In individual chemical analyses comparing the highest to lowest
quintiles, postmenopausal breast cancer risk was elevated for mercury (hazard
ratio [HR]=1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-1.5), cadmium (HR=1.1, 95%CI:
0.96-1.3), and lead (HR=1.1, 95%CI: 0.98-1.3). The weighted quantile sum index
was associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (odds ratio (OR)=1.1, 95%CI:
1.0-1.1). Consistent with the individual chemical analysis, the most highly
weighted chemicals for predicting postmenopausal breast cancer risk were lead,
cadmium, and mercury. Results were attenuated for overall breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of some airborne metals, specifically mercury,
cadmium, and lead, were associated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breast
cancer.

Purpose: This study aimed to compare the swallowing function in patients with
human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated
with de-intensified chemoradiation therapy (6 weeks, 60 Gy) versus those
receiving standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy (7 weeks, 70 Gy).
Methods and materials: A retrospective review was conducted of 78 patients with
human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with
modified barium swallow studies pretreatment and 6 to 8 weeks posttreatment. The 
swallowing function was objectively scored for penetration, aspiration, and
pharyngeal residue. Forty patients received de-intensified chemoradiation therapy
(60 Gy image guided radiation therapy with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2) and 38
patients received standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy (70 Gy image guided
radiation therapy with chemotherapy of the medical oncologist's choosing).
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect differences between
the cohorts with regard to laryngeal penetration, aspiration, and pharyngeal
residue. A multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the overall
effect of treatment on the swallowing function. Patient-reported swallowing
outcomes in de-intensified cohort were assessed with the European Organisation
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Module for Head and Neck
Cancer and the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events questionnaires.
Results: Patients treated with de-intensified chemoradiation therapy were
associated with a suggestion of lower risk of developing overall swallowing
dysfunction (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; P = .07), laryngeal penetration (OR, 0.63;
P = .12), and pharyngeal residue (OR, 0.61; P = .08). The mean pre- and 2-year
post-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
scores pertaining to swallowing (1-4 scale, higher worse) in the de-intensified
cohort were 1.4 and 1.2 for liquids; 1.2 and 1.1 for purees; 1.5 and 1.7 for
solids, 1.0 and 1.3 for choked when swallowing; and 9.0 and 10.8 for composite
score, respectively. The mean pre- and 2-year post-Patient-Reported Outcomes
version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events swallowing
difficulty scores (1-5 scale, with higher scores being worse) were 1.5 and 1.8,
respectively.
Conclusions: Compared with 7 weeks of 70 Gy, 6 weeks of 60 Gy de-intensified
chemoradiation therapy appears to better preserve the baseline swallowing
function (per objective modified barium swallow assessment). Patients treated
with de-intensified chemoradiation therapy reported minimal changes in swallowing
function.

Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and over 60% express
wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR); however, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have
limited effect in most patients with wtEGFR tumors. We previously identified
MERTK tyrosine kinase as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC and developed
MRX-2843, a novel MERTK-selective inhibitor with favorable properties for
clinical translation. The goal of this study was to determine whether MERTK and
EGFR inhibitor combination therapy could provide antitumor efficacy against
wtEGFR NSCLC.Experimental Design: An unbiased screen of 378 kinase inhibitors was
conducted to identify synergistic interactions with MRX-2843 and biochemical and 
therapeutic effects were determined in vitro and in vivo Results: Numerous
irreversible EGFR TKIs, including CO-1686 and osimertinib, synergized with
MRX-2843 to inhibit wtEGFR NSCLC cell expansion, irrespective of driver oncogene 
status. CO-1686 and MRX-2843 combination therapy inhibited MERTK, wtEGFR, and
ERBB2/ERBB3 and decreased downstream PI3K-AKT, MAPK-ERK, and AURORA kinase (AURK)
signaling more effectively than single agents. Inhibition of PI3K, AKT or AURK,
but not MEK, synergized with CO-1686 to inhibit tumor cell expansion, suggesting 
their roles as key redundant resistance pathways. Treatment with MRX-2843 and
CO-1686 or osimertinib prevented xenograft growth while single agents had limited
effect. Tumor growth inhibition was durable even after treatment with combination
therapy was stopped.Conclusions: Our data support the application of MRX-2843 in 
combination with an irreversible EGFR TKI as a novel strategy for treatment of
patients with wtEGFR NSCLC. Clin Cancer Res; 1-13. ©2018 AACR.

Three new bis(2,2'-bipyridine)-heteroleptic Ru(II) dyads incorporating thienyl
groups (n = 1-3, compounds 1, 2 and 3, respectively) appended to
1,10-phenanthroline were synthesized and characterized to investigate the impact 
of n on the photophysical and photobiological properties within the series. All
three complexes showed unstructured emission near 618 nm from a triplet
metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3 MLCT) state with a lifetime (τem ) of
approximately 1 μs. Transient absorption measurements revealed an additional
excited state that was nonemissive and long-lived (τTA  = 43 μs for 2 and 27 μs
for 3), assigned as a triplet intraligand (3 IL) state that was accessible only
in 2 and 3. All three complexes were strong singlet oxygen (1 O2 ) sensitizers,
with quantum yields (Φ∆ ) for 2 and 3 being the largest (74-78%), and all three
were photocytotoxic to cancer cells with visible light activation in the order:
3 > 2 > 1. Cell-free DNA photodamage followed the same trend, where potency
increased with decreasing 3 IL energy. Compounds 2 and 3 also showed in vitro
photobiological effects with red light (625 nm), where their molar absorptivities
were <100 m-1  cm-1 . These findings highlight that Ru(II) dyads derived from
α-oligothiophenes directly appended to 1,10-phenanthroline-namely 2 and 3-possess
low-lying 3 IL states that are highly photosensitizing, and they may therefore be
of interest for photobiological applications such as photodynamic therapy (PDT).

The Clinical Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research (CSER) consortium, now in
its second funding cycle, is investigating the effectiveness of integrating
genomic (exome or genome) sequencing into the clinical care of diverse and
medically underserved individuals in a variety of healthcare settings and disease
states. The consortium comprises a coordinating center, six funded extramural
clinical projects, and an ongoing National Human Genome Research Institute
(NHGRI) intramural project. Collectively, these projects aim to enroll and
sequence over 6,100 participants in four years. At least 60% of participants will
be of non-European ancestry or from underserved settings, with the goal of
diversifying the populations that are providing an evidence base for genomic
medicine. Five of the six clinical projects are enrolling pediatric patients with
various phenotypes. One of these five projects is also enrolling couples whose
fetus has a structural anomaly, and the sixth project is enrolling adults at risk
for hereditary cancer. The ongoing NHGRI intramural project has enrolled
primarily healthy adults. Goals of the consortium include assessing the clinical 
utility of genomic sequencing, exploring medical follow up and cascade testing of
relatives, and evaluating patient-provider-laboratory level interactions that
influence the use of this technology. The findings from the CSER consortium will 
offer patients, healthcare systems, and policymakers a clearer understanding of
the opportunities and challenges of providing genomic medicine in diverse
populations and settings, and contribute evidence toward developing best
practices for the delivery of clinically useful and cost-effective genomic
sequencing in diverse healthcare settings.

Cyanobacteria are a source of chemically diverse metabolites with potential
medicinal and biotechnological applications. Rapid identification of compounds is
central to expedite the natural product discovery process. Mass spectrometry has 
been shown to be an important tool for dereplication of complex natural product
samples. In addition, chromatographic separation and complementary spectroscopic 
analysis (e.g., UV) can enhance the confidence of the dereplication process.
Here, we applied a droplet-liquid microjunction-surface sampling probe (droplet
probe) coupled with UPLC-PDA-HRMS-MS/MS to identify two new natural products in
situ from the freshwater strain Calothrix sp. UIC 10520. This allowed us to
prioritize this strain for chemical investigation based on the presence of new
metabolites very early in our discovery process, saving both time and resources. 
Subsequently, calothrixamides A (1) and B (2) were isolated from large-scale
cultures, and the structures were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and
mass spectrometry. The absolute configurations were determined by a combination
of chemical degradation reactions, derivatization methods (Mosher's, Marfey's,
and phenylglycine methyl ester), and J-based configurational analysis.
Calothrixamides showed no cytotoxic activity against the MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, 
and OVCAR3 cancer cell lines. They represent the first functionalized long-chain 
fatty acid amides reported from the Calothrix genus and from a freshwater
cyanobacterium.

BACKGROUND: Adding modified FOLFOX6 (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin)
after chemoradiotherapy and lengthening the chemoradiotherapy-to-surgery interval
is associated with an increase in the proportion of rectal cancer patients with a
pathological complete response.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze disease-free and overall
survival.
DESIGN: This was a nonrandomized phase II trial.
SETTINGS: The study was conducted at multiple institutions.
PATIENTS: Four sequential study groups with stage II or III rectal cancer were
included.
INTERVENTION: All of the patients received 50 Gy of radiation with concurrent
continuous infusion of fluorouracil for 5 weeks. Patients in each group received 
0, 2, 4, or 6 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiation and before total
mesorectal excision. Patients were recommended to receive adjuvant chemotherapy
after surgery to complete a total of 8 cycles of modified FOLFOX6.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The trial was powered to detect differences in
pathological complete response, which was reported previously. Disease-free and
overall survival are the main outcomes for the current study.
RESULTS: Of 259 patients, 211 had a complete follow-up. Median follow-up was 59
months (range, 9-125 mo). The mean number of total chemotherapy cycles differed
among the 4 groups (p = 0.002), because one third of patients in the group
assigned to no preoperative FOLFOX did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy.
Disease-free survival was significantly associated with study group, ypTNM stage,
and pathological complete response (p = 0.004, <0.001, and 0.001). A secondary
analysis including only patients who received ≥1 cycle of FOLFOX still showed
differences in survival between study groups (p = 0.03).
LIMITATIONS: The trial was not randomized and was not powered to show differences
in survival. Survival data were not available for 19% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Adding modified FOLFOX6 after chemoradiotherapy and before total
mesorectal excision increases compliance with systemic chemotherapy and
disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
Neoadjuvant consolidation chemotherapy may have benefits beyond increasing
pathological complete response rates. See Video Abstract at

Although patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health-related quality of
life, are important endpoints in randomised controlled trials (RCTs), there is
little consensus about the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of these data.
We did a systematic review to assess the variability, quality, and standards of
PRO data analyses in advanced breast cancer RCTs. We searched PubMed for English 
language articles published in peer-reviewed journals between Jan 1, 2001, and
Oct 30, 2017. Eligible articles were those that reported PRO results from RCTs of
adult patients with advanced breast cancer receiving anti-cancer treatments with 
reported sample sizes of at least 50 patients-66 RCTs met the selection criteria.
Only eight (12%) RCTs reported a specific PRO research hypothesis. Heterogeneity 
in the statistical methods used to assess PRO data was observed, with a mixture
of longitudinal and cross-sectional techniques. Not all articles addressed the
problem of multiple testing. Fewer than half of RCTs (28 [42%]) reported the
clinical significance of their findings. 48 (73%) did not report how missing data
were handled. Our systematic review shows a need to improve standards in the
analysis, interpretation, and reporting of PRO data in cancer RCTs. Lack of
standardisation makes it difficult to draw robust conclusions and compare
findings across trials. The Setting International Standards in the Analyzing
Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Data Consortium was set up to
address this need and develop recommendations on the analysis of PRO data in
RCTs.

BACKGROUND: TRC105 is an IgG1 endoglin monoclonal antibody that potentiates VEGF 
inhibitors in preclinical models. We assessed safety, pharmacokinetics, and
antitumor activity of TRC105 in combination with axitinib in patients with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Heavily pretreated mRCC patients were treated
with TRC105 weekly (8 mg/kg and then 10 mg/kg) in combination with axitinib
(initially at 5 mg b.i.d. and then escalated per patient tolerance to a maximum
of 10 mg b.i.d.) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using a
standard 3 + 3 phase I design.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median number of prior therapies = 3) were treated.
TRC105 dose escalation proceeded to 10 mg/kg weekly without dose-limiting
toxicity. Adverse event characteristics of each drug were not increased in
frequency or severity when the two drugs were administered concurrently. TRC105
and axitinib demonstrated preliminary evidence of activity, including partial
responses (PR) by RECIST in 29% of patients, and median progression-free survival
(11.3 months). None of the patients with PR had PR to prior first-line treatment.
Lower baseline levels of osteopontin and higher baseline levels of TGF-β receptor
3 correlated with overall response rate.
CONCLUSION: TRC105 at 8 and 10 mg/kg weekly was well tolerated in combination
with axitinib, with encouraging evidence of activity in patients with mRCC. A
multicenter, randomized phase II trial of TRC105 and axitinib has recently
completed enrollment (NCT01806064).
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: TRC105 is a monoclonal antibody to endoglin (CD105), a
receptor densely expressed on proliferating endothelial cells and also on renal
cancer stem cells that is implicated as a mediator of resistance to inhibitors of
the VEGF pathway. In this Phase I trial, TRC105 combined safely with axitinib at 
the recommended single agent doses of each drug in patients with renal cell
carcinoma. The combination demonstrated durable activity in a VEGF
inhibitor-refractory population and modulated several angiogenic biomarkers. A
randomized Phase II trial testing TRC105 in combination with axitinib in clear
cell renal cell carcinoma has completed accrual.

Several flavonoids and their biosynthetic precursor chalcones were designed and
synthesized to improve the biological effects of the lead compound
2'-hydroxyflavonone against androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcriptional
stimulation. Newly synthesized chalcones 19 and 26 suppressed AR-dependent
transcription as well as DHT-dependent growth stimulation at a low micromolar
level. These compounds were also effective against ligand-independent
constitutively active mutant AR derived from castration-resistant PCa (CRPC).
Compounds 19 and 26 showed broad spectrum antiproliferative activity at 5-10 μM
against multiple tumor cell lines including androgen-independent and
taxane-resistant prostate cancer as well as a multidrug-resistant subline. Mode
of action studies suggested that 19 induced sub-G1 accumulation in PC-3 cells by 
disrupting the microtubule network without affecting cell cycle progression.
Furthermore, the in vivo effectiveness of chalcone 19 was confirmed in a
xenograft model antitumor assay. Thus, chalcone 19 has the potential to be a
bifunctional lead for treatment of AR-dependent PCa at lower doses as well as
AR-independent PCa, including CRPC, at higher doses.

HPV vaccine uptake remains below national goals in the US, driven in part by
parental uncertainty about the vaccine fueled by negative stories on social media
and other information platforms. To identify opportunities for mobilizing parents
to increase HPV vaccination uptake, the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable and
Vaccinate Adolescents Against Cancers program convened two national meetings in
2016 at the American Cancer Society. Stakeholders recommended a focus on positive
message to parents; cultivating parent champions to use the power of personal
storytelling and to distribute these messages; and defining the role of national 
organizations in supporting parent champions. Stakeholders supported three
message themes: HPV vaccination is the norm, HPV vaccination is cancer
prevention, and HPV vaccination supports families across generations. Parents'
negative stories about vaccination are especially difficult to counteract with
scientific evidence, making the cultivation of pro-vaccine parent champions an
especially promising intervention on social media and other information
platforms.

Liver metastases develop in more than half of patients with colorectal cancer
(CRC) and are associated with a poor prognosis. The factors influencing liver
metastasis of CRC are poorly characterized, but this information is urgently
needed. We have now discovered that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, exosomes)
derived from CRC can be specifically targeted to liver tissue and induce liver
macrophage polarization toward an interleukin-6 (IL-6)-secreting pro-inflammatory
phenotype. More importantly, we found that microRNA-21-5p (miR-21) was highly
enriched in CRC-derived sEVs and was essential for creating a liver
pro-inflammatory phenotype and liver metastasis of CRC. Silencing either miR-21
in CRC-sEVs or Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in macrophages, to which miR-21 binds,
abolished CRC-sEVs' induction of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore,
miR-21 expression in plasma-derived sEVs was positively correlated with liver
metastasis in CRC patients. Collectively, our data demonstrate a pivotal role of 
CRC-sEVs in promoting liver metastasis by inducing an inflammatory pre-metastatic
niche through the miR-21-TLR7-IL6 axis. Thus, sEVs-miR-21 represents a potential 
prognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC patients with liver metastasis.

Purpose In April 2017, the American Urological Association, American Society for 
Radiation Oncology, and Society of Urologic Oncology released a joint
evidence-based practice guideline on clinically localized prostate cancer. The
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has a policy and set of procedures
for endorsing clinical practice guidelines that have been developed by other
professional organizations. Methods The Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer
guideline was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. An ASCO Expert 
Panel then reviewed the content and the recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert 
Panel determined that the recommendations from the Clinically Localized Prostate 
Cancer guideline were clear, thorough, and based upon the most relevant
scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer
guideline except for two recommendations on cryosurgery. The two recommendations 
covering cryosurgery were not endorsed because the panel found that there is
insufficient evidence to support the use of cryotherapy in this setting.
Recommendations The ASCO Expert Panel endorsed all but two of the original
guideline recommendations as written and offered a series of discussion points to
guide practice.

RNA-based, multi-gene molecular assays are available and widely used for patients
with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancers. However, RNA-based genomic tests
can be costly and are not available in many countries. Methods for inferring
molecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely to
benefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit from
molecular testing based on H&E stained histologic images, we developed an image
analysis approach using deep learning. A training set of 571 breast tumors was
used to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAM50
intrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). The
resulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (n = 288), and
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set.
Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs.
high tumor grade (82% accuracy), ER status (84% accuracy), Basal-like vs.
non-Basal-like (77% accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (94% accuracy), and high vs.
low-medium ROR-PT score (75% accuracy). Sampling considerations in the training
set minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status was
significantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof of
principle that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker
(i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy >75% based on H&E features.
Image-based methods could be promising for identifying patients with a greater
need for further genomic testing, or in place of classically scored variables
typically accomplished using human-based scoring.

The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) is supported by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) to develop expertly curated and freely accessible resources defining
the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and
research. To facilitate expert input, ClinGen has formed Clinical Domain Working 
Groups (CDWGs) to leverage the collective knowledge of clinicians, laboratory
diagnosticians, and researchers. In the initial phase of ClinGen, CDWGs were
launched in the cardiovascular, hereditary cancer, and inborn errors of
metabolism clinical fields. These early CDWGs established the infrastructure
necessary to implement standardized processes developed or adopted by ClinGen
working groups for the interpretation of gene-disease associations and variant
pathogenicity, and provided a sustainable model for the formation of future
disease-focused curation groups. The establishment of CDWGs requires recruitment 
of international experts to broadly represent the interests of their field and
ensure that assertions made are reliable and widely accepted. Building on the
successes, challenges, and trade-offs made in establishing the original CDWGs,
ClinGen has developed standard operating procedures for the development of CDWGs 
in new clinical domains, while maximizing efforts to scale up curation and
facilitate involvement of external groups who wish to utilize ClinGen methods and
infrastructure for expert curation.

OBJECTIVES: Self-collection of samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing
(self-collection) has the potential to increase cervical cancer screening among
underscreened women. We assessed attitudes toward at-home HPV self-collection
compared with clinic-based Pap testing in this higher-risk population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were low-income women in North Carolina
overdue for cervical cancer screening. Women self-collected samples at home,
returned samples by mail for HPV testing, and completed phone questionnaires
about at-home HPV self-collection. Participants were referred to clinic-based Pap
testing and invited to complete a second questionnaire about Pap testing. A
cross-sectional questionnaire compared attitudes, experiences, and preferences
for self-collection versus Pap testing and assessed predictors of preference for 
HPV self-collection.
RESULTS: Half (51%) of 221 women reported a preference for HPV self-collection,
19% preferred Pap testing, and 27% reported no preference. More women reported
difficulty finding time to do the Pap test (31%) than the self-test (13%, p =
.003) and being afraid of the self-test results (50%) than the Pap test results
(36%, p = .02). There were relatively fewer reports of physical discomfort and
pain from self-collection than Pap testing (discomfort: 18% self; 48% Pap; pain: 
8% self; 30% Pap, p = .001). No differences were found in positive versus
negative thoughts about the tests, trust in the tests' safety and accuracy, or
willingness to do tests again.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall positive attitudes toward HPV self-collection compared with 
Pap testing among underscreened women suggest that self-collection is a promising
option to increase cervical cancer screening in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The original Possibilities for Activity Scale (PActS) examined
the internalised societal pressures of older adults with cancer. Previous
research found that scores from the original PActS scale were associated with
participation in meaningful activity. Women of working age may have different
societal pressures than older adults, which could impact their quality of life.
Our aims were to (i) adapt the scale specifically for women, (ii) test convergent
and structural validity and (iii) test internal consistency reliability.
METHOD: First, we completed a literature review to add new items, then measured
psychometric properties of PActS-W.
FINDINGS: A total of 186 women, one month after cancer surgery completed PActS-W.
PActS-W demonstrated convergent-related (physical health r = 0.40, mental health 
r = 0.30, P < 0.01), structural validity (CFI, 0.96; RMSEA, 0.10; IFI, 0.96, NFI,
0.94) and high internal consistency reliability (stratified coefficient
α = 0.90).
CONCLUSION: The PActS-W may be useful for measuring women's internalised societal
pressures after encountering cancer, which relates to their quality of life, but 
further testing is needed.

Lymphadenectomy is a crucial part of the surgical therapy for gastric cancer. The
number of normal lymph nodes could indicate the number of nodes that need to be
retrieved during the procedure. The aim of this study is to analyze the number of
lymph nodes in cadavers without gastric cancer according to the Japanese Gastric 
Cancer Association guidelines. Twenty fresh adult cadavers (14 males, mean age
55, range 24-93 years) were used. Abdominal lymph nodes were dissected and
classified according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. For total
gastrectomy, the median number of lymph nodes that comprised D1 + dissection was 
27 (range 15-42). The median and mean number of lymph nodes that comprised D2
dissection was 33, ranging from 18 to 50. For distal gastrectomy, the D1 + level 
comprised a median of 21 lymph nodes (range 11-38), and the D2 level 22 lymph
nodes (range 11-39). In conclusion, considering gastrectomy + D2 lymphadenectomy 
as the standard treatment for gastric cancer, our results show that adequate
lymphadenectomy must encompass around 30 lymph nodes. Clin. Anat., 2018. © 2018

BACKGROUND: Published guidelines do not address what the minimum incremental
diagnostic yield (IDY) for detection of dysplasia/cancer is required over the
standard Seattle protocol for an advanced imaging modality (AIM) to be
implemented in routine surveillance of Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients. We
aimed to report expert practice patterns and attitudes, specifically addressing
the minimum IDY in the use of AIMs in BE surveillance.
METHODS: An international group of BE experts completed an anonymous electronic
survey of domains relevant to surveillance practice patterns and use of AIMs. The
evaluated AIMs were conventional chromoendoscopy (CC), virtual chromoendoscopy
(VC), volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE), confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE),
and wide-area transepithelial sampling (WATS3D). Responses were recorded using
five-point balanced Likert items and analyzed as continuous variables.
RESULTS: The survey response rate was 84% (61/73)-41 US and 20 non-US. Experts
were most comfortable with and routinely use VC and CC, and least comfortable
with and rarely use VLE, CLE, and WATS3D. Experts rated data from randomized
controlled trials (1.4 ± 0.9) and guidelines (2.6 ± 1.2) as the two most
influential factors for implementing AIMs in clinical practice. The minimum IDY
of AIMs over standard biopsies to be considered of clinical benefit was lowest
for VC (15%, IQR 10-29%) and highest for VLE (30%, IQR 20-50%). Compared to US

Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer in the United States with an 
increasing incidence. Melanoma lesions often exhibit high immunogenicity, with
infiltrating immune cells playing important roles in regression of tumors
occurring spontaneously or caused by therapeutic treatment. Computational and
experimental methods have been used to estimate the abundance of immune cells in 
tumors, but their applications are limited by the requirement of large gene sets 
or multiple antibodies. Although the prognostic role of immune cells has been
appreciated, a systematic investigation of their association with clinical
factors, genomic features, prognosis and treatment response in melanoma is still 
lacking. This study, identifies a 25-gene signature based on RNA-seq data from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (TCGA-SKCM) dataset. This 
signature was used to calculate sample-specific Leukocyte Infiltration Scores
(LIS) in six independent melanoma microarray datasets and scores were found to
vary substantially between different melanoma lesion sites and molecular
subtypes. For metastatic melanoma, LIS was prognostic in all datasets with high
LIS being associated with good survival. The current approach provided additional
prognostic information over established clinical factors, including age, tumor
stage, and gender. In addition, LIS was predictive of patient survival in stage
III melanoma, and treatment efficacy of tumor-specific antigen
vaccine.Implications: This study identifies a 25-gene signature that effectively 
estimates the level of immune cell infiltration in melanoma, which provides a
robust biomarker for predicting patient prognosis. Mol Cancer Res; 1-11. ©2018

BACKGROUND: Removal of the fallopian tubes at the time of hysterectomy or
interval sterilization has become routine practice to prevent ovarian cancer.
While emerging as a strategy, uptake of this procedure at the time of cesarean
delivery for pregnant women seeking permanent sterilization has not been widely
adopted due to perceptions of increased morbidity and operative difficulty with a
lack of available data in this setting.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing
strategies for long-term sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction at the
time of cesarean delivery, including bilateral tubal ligation, opportunistic
salpingectomy, and long-acting reversible contraception.
STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model was constructed
for pregnant women undergoing cesarean delivery who desired permanent
sterilization in the US population, comparing 3 strategies: (1) bilateral tubal
ligation, (2) bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy, and (3) postpartum
long-acting reversible contraception. This theoretic cohort consisted of 110,000 
pregnant women desiring permanent sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery 
and ovarian cancer prevention at an average of 35 years who were monitored for an
additional 40 years based on an average US female life expectancy of 75 years.
The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years. Secondary outcomes
included: the number of ovarian cancer cases and deaths, procedure-related
complications, and unintended and ectopic pregnancies. The 1-, 2-, and 3-way and 
Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The
willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000.
RESULTS: Both bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy 
with cesarean delivery have favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. In the base case
analysis, salpingectomy was more cost-effective with an incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,189 per quality-adjusted life year compared to
tubal ligation. Long-acting reversible contraception after cesarean was not
cost-effective (ie, dominated). Although salpingectomy and tubal ligation were
both cost-effective over a wide range of cost and risk estimates, the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio analysis was highly sensitive to the uncertainty around 
the estimates of salpingectomy cancer risk reduction, risk of perioperative
complications, and cost. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated
that tubal ligation had a 49% chance of being the preferred strategy over
salpingectomy. If the true salpingectomy risk of perioperative complications is
>2% higher than tubal ligation or if the cancer risk reduction of salpingectomy
is <52%, then tubal ligation is the preferred, more cost-effective strategy.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy
with cesarean delivery are both cost-effective strategies for permanent
sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction. Although salpingectomy and tubal
ligation are both reasonable strategies for cesarean patients seeking permanent
sterilization and cancer risk reduction, threshold analyses indicate that the
risks and benefits of salpingectomy with cesarean delivery need to be better
defined before a preferred strategy can be determined.

Achalasia is a relatively rare primary motor esophageal disorder, characterized
by absence of relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter and of peristalsis
along the esophageal body. As a result, patients typically present with
dysphagia, regurgitation and occasionally chest pain, pulmonary complication and 
malnutrition. New diagnostic methodologies and therapeutic techniques have been
recently added to the armamentarium for treating achalasia. With the aim to offer
clinicians and patients an up-to-date framework for making informed decisions on 
the management of this disease, the International Society for Diseases of the
Esophagus Guidelines proposed and endorsed the Esophageal Achalasia Guidelines
(I-GOAL). The guidelines were prepared according the Appraisal of Guidelines for 
Research and Evaluation (AGREE-REX) tool, accredited for guideline production by 
NICE UK. A systematic literature search was performed and the quality of evidence
and the strength of recommendations were graded according to the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Given the
relative rarity of this disease and the paucity of high-level evidence in the
literature, this process was integrated with a three-step process of anonymous
voting on each statement (DELPHI). Only statements with an approval rate >80%
were accepted in the guidelines. Fifty-one experts from 11 countries and 3
representatives from patient support associations participated to the
preparations of the guidelines. These guidelines deal specifically with the
following achalasia issues: Diagnostic workup, Definition of the disease,
Severity of presentation, Medical treatment, Botulinum Toxin injection, Pneumatic
dilatation, POEM, Other endoscopic treatments, Laparoscopic myotomy, Definition
of recurrence, Follow up and risk of cancer, Management of end stage achalasia,
Treatment options for failure, Achalasia in children, Achalasia secondary to
Chagas' disease.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is performed 
at longer time intervals than the fecal occult blood test or screens for breast
or prostate cancer. This causes concerns about interval cancers, which have been 
proposed to progress more rapidly. We compared outcomes of patients with interval
CRCs after sigmoidoscopy screening vs outcomes of patients with CRC who had not
been screened.
METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized sigmoidoscopy
screening trial in Norway with 98,684 participants (age 50-64 years) who were
randomly assigned to groups that were (n=20,552) or were not (n=78,126) invited
for sigmoidoscopy screening from 1999 through 2001; participants were followed
for a median 14.8 years. We compared CRC mortality and all-cause mortality
between individuals who underwent screening and were diagnosed with CRC 30 days
or more after screening (interval cancer group, n=163) and individuals diagnosed 
with CRC in the non-screened group (controls, n=1740). All CRCs in the control
group were identified when they developed symptoms (clinically detected CRCs).
Analyses were stratified by cancer site. We used Cox regression to estimate
hazard ratio (HRs), adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS: Over the follow-up period, 43 individuals in the interval cancer group
died from CRC; among controls, 525 died from CRC. Colorectal cancer mortality
(adjusted HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.72-1.35; P=.92), rectosigmoid cancer mortality
(adjusted HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.63-1.92; P=.74), and all-cause mortality (adjusted 
HR, 0.99; 95% CI 0.76-1.27; P=.91) did not differ significantly between the
interval cancer group and controls. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00119912
CONCLUSION: In this randomized sigmoidoscopy screening trial, mortality did not
differ significantly between individuals with interval CRCs and unscreened
patients with clinically detected CRCs.

The increasing incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in younger adults (age <50
years) has been widely reported. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, 
and End Results Program, we young-onset CRC incidence rates decreased from 1975
through about 1990. Decreases were more prominent in the colon, a contrast with
more recent increases in rectal cancer. Incidence rates subsequently increased,
differing by time period and 5-year age group. This inflection point is
consistent with a birth cohort effect and points to early life exposures -
accumulated throughout the life course - that may increase cancer risk. Studying 
early life exposures among persons born after 1960 may advance our understanding 
of CRC in younger adults.

Obesity increases the risk of multiple gastrointestinal cancers and worsens
disease outcomes. Conversely, strong inverse associations have emerged between
physical activity and colon cancer and possibly other gastrointestinal
malignancies. The effect of weight loss interventions - such as modifications of 
diet and/or physical activity or bariatric surgery - remains unclear in patients 
who are obese and have gastrointestinal cancer, although large clinical trials
are underway. Human intervention studies have already shed light on potential
mechanisms underlying the energy balance-cancer relationship, with preclinical
models supporting emerging pathway effects. Central to interventions that reduce 
obesity or increase physical activity are pluripotent cancer-preventive effects
(including reduced systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and angiogenesis,
altered adipokine levels and improved insulin resistance) that directly interface
with the hallmarks of cancer. Other mechanisms, such as DNA repair, oxidative
stress and telomere length, immune function, effects on cancer stem cells and the
microbiome, could also contribute to energy balance effects on gastrointestinal
cancers. Although some mechanisms are well understood (for instance, systemic
effects on inflammation and insulin signalling), other areas remain unclear. The 
current state of knowledge supports the need to better integrate mechanistic
approaches with preclinical and human studies to develop effective, personalized 
diet and exercise interventions to reduce the burden of obesity on
gastrointestinal cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer of adolescents and young adult (AYA)
women aged 15 to 39 years, accounting for 5.6% of all invasive breast cancer in
women. In comparison with older women, AYAs are more likely to have familial
cancer predisposition genes, larger breast tumors, unfavorable biological
characteristics, distant metastatic disease at diagnosis, and adverse outcome.
Endocrine therapy and some chemotherapy recommendations differ between young and 
older women. AYAs require coordinated multidisciplinary care, treatment regimens 
that minimize late effects such as premature menopause and osteoporosis, and
proactive management of psychological and sexual health during and after cancer
treatment.

High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer with poor outcome. Accurate
preoperative overall survival (OS) time prediction for HGG patients is crucial
for treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS prediction
studies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on the
magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the highly complex lesion MRI
appearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurate
individualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namely
brain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-state 
functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional networks
where the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesion
appearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics features
could capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated with
prognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse representation with
regional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional connectivity (FC) networks
(characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamics
FC time courses). Then, we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networks
for a jointly, machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on a
preliminary dataset (N = 34 with bad OS, mean OS, ~400 days; N = 34 with good OS,
mean OS, ~1030 days), we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy (86.8%) on
separating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS. However, if using
only conventionally derived descriptive features (e.g., age and tumor
characteristics), the accuracy is low (63.2%). Our study highlights the
importance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional connectomics for treatment
planning.

Overuse of clinical preventive services increases healthcare costs and may
deprive underserved patients of necessary care. Up to 45% of cervical cancer
screening is overuse. We conducted a systematic review of correlates of overuse
of cervical cancer screening and interventions to reduce overuse. The search
identified 25 studies (20 observational; 5 intervention). Correlates varied by
the type of overuse measured (i.e., too frequent, before/after recommended age to
start or stop screening, after hysterectomy), the most common correlates of
overuse related to patient age (n = 7), OBGYN practice or provider (n = 5),
location (n = 4), and marital status (n = 4). Six observational studies reported 
a decrease in overuse over time. Screening overuse decreased in all intervention 
studies, which used before-after designs with no control or comparison groups.
Observational studies suggest potential targets for de-escalating overuse.
Randomized clinical trials are needed to establish best practices for reducing
overuse.

Regularized variable selection is a powerful tool for identifying the true
regression model from a large number of candidates by applying penalties to the
objective functions. The penalty functions typically involve a tuning parameter
that control the complexity of the selected model. The ability of the regularized
variable selection methods to identify the true model critically depends on the
correct choice of the tuning parameter. In this study we develop a consistent
tuning parameter selection method for regularized Cox's proportional hazards
model with a diverging number of parameters. The tuning parameter is selected by 
minimizing the generalized information criterion. We prove that, for any penalty 
that possesses the oracle property, the proposed tuning parameter selection
method identifies the true model with probability approaching one as sample size 
increases. Its finite sample performance is evaluated by simulations. Its
practical use is demonstrated in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer
data.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze self-reported changes in physical function in older women 
with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907
prospective randomized clinical trial.
SETTING: CALGB institutions in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 65 and older with Stage I to III breast cancer enrolled 
in CALGB 49907 who had physical function data from before and after receipt of
adjuvant chemotherapy (N=256; mean age 71.5, range 65-85).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants were administered the physical function subscale of
the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
Questionnaire before chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, and 12 months
after chemotherapy initiation. Functional decline was defined as a more than
10-point decrease from baseline at each time point. Resilience was defined as
return to within 10 points of baseline. Multivariable regression was used to
examine pretreatment characteristics associated with physical function changes.
RESULTS: Of 42% of participants who had physical function decline from before to 
the end of chemotherapy, 47% recovered by 12 months (were resilient). Almost
one-third experienced functional decline from before chemotherapy to 12 months
later. Pretreatment fatigue was a risk factor for functional decline from before 
to the end of chemotherapy (P=.02). Risk factors for functional decline at 12
months included pretreatment dyspnea (P=.007) and being unmarried (P=.01).
CONCLUSION: Functional decline was common in older women receiving adjuvant
chemotherapy for breast cancer in a clinical trial. Although half recovered their
physical function, one-third had a clinically meaningful decline at 12 months.
Strategies are needed to prevent functional decline in older adults receiving
chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Chronic pain, depression, and fatigue are common effects resulting from 
the cancer experience; new interventions are needed. This study examined the
effect of Reimagine, an online symptom self-management curriculum that teaches
coping skills, on key outcomes.
METHODS: Adult breast cancer survivors with chronic pain were recruited from the 
Army of Women volunteer registry for this randomized controlled trial and
randomized 1:1 to Reimagine or usual care conditions. Electronic surveys
collected demographic, clinical, and outcome data at baseline and 18 weeks
post-intervention.
RESULTS: Participants (N = 89) were mean age 56.7 ± 8.7 years; 67% married; 58%
employed; mean years since diagnosis 8.2 ± 6.6; and 89% were in remission or
cured of their breast cancer. There was a significant difference in the change in
depression scores for treatment (M = - 1.7, SD = 4.5) and usual care (M = 0.3,
SD = 3.8) conditions; t(85) = - 2.3, p = .03. Difference in the change in fatigue
scores was significant for treatment (M = 4.8, SD = 9.0) and usual care (M = 1.2,
SD = 6.6) conditions; t(87) = 2.2, p = .03. Most Reimagine users (94%) would
recommend the curriculum to others.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Reimagine has an effect on depression and
fatigue symptoms for breast cancer survivors. Online programs can be a feasible
and effective alternative to in-person support. Additional research is
recommended with larger and more diverse samples.

OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of access to and use or provision of palliative 
care services in medically underserved and vulnerable groups diagnosed with
cancer.
DATA SOURCES: Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science were searched
to identify peer-reviewed studies that described palliative care in medically
underserved or vulnerable populations diagnosed with cancer.
CONCLUSION: Disparities in both access and referral to palliative care are
evident in many underserved groups. There is evidence that some groups received
poorer quality of such care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Achieving health equity in access to and
receipt of quality palliative care requires prioritization of this area in
clinical practice and in research funding.

CONTEXT: Lung cancer is associated with significant distress, poor quality of
life, and a median prognosis of less than one year. Benefits of shared decision
making (SDM) have been described for multiple diseases, either by the use of
decisions aids or as part of supportive care interventions.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to summarize the effects of
interventions facilitating SDM on distress and health care utilization among
patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search in the CINAHL, Cochrane,
EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO databases. Studies were eligible when conducted in
a population of patients with lung cancer, evaluated the effects of an
intervention that facilitated SDM, and measured distress and/or health care
utilization as outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 12 studies, detailed in 13 publications, were included: nine 
randomized trials and three retrospective cohort studies. All studies reported on
a supportive care intervention facilitating SDM as part of their intervention.
Eight studies described effects on distress, and eight studies measured effects
on health care utilization. No effect was found in studies measuring generic
distress. Positive effects, in favor of the intervention groups, were observed in
studies using anxiety-specific measures (n = 1) or depression-specific measures
(n = 3). Evidence for reductions in health care utilization was found in five
studies.
CONCLUSION: Although not supported by all studies, our findings suggest that
facilitating SDM in the context of lung cancer may lead to improved emotional
outcomes and less aggressive therapies. Future studies, explicitly studying the
effects of SDM by using decision aids, are needed to better elucidate potential
benefits.

Cervical cancer is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer death among women
worldwide, with most cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. Safe,
highly effective vaccines against HPV have been on the market since 2006, yet
only 6% of girls worldwide have received this life-saving cancer prevention
intervention. International organizations, including PATH, Gavi, and the
pharmaceutical companies Merck and GlaxoSmithKline, have provided support to
eligible low- and middle-income countries to implement national HPV vaccination
programs. Still, glaring disparities in the availability of national HPV
vaccination programs and the coverage of the primary target population between
the global north and south persist. We illustrate worldwide HPV vaccine
implementation and coverage using an online data visualization, which is publicly
available and can be used to gain unique insights. We also present three emerging
solutions to transform future HPV vaccine delivery in low- and middle-income
countries: low-cost generics, single-dose vaccination, and co-administration with
other adolescent vaccines. By rapidly expanding access to HPV vaccination to
girls everywhere, vaccine-type HPV infections can be virtually eliminated. At
high vaccination-coverage levels, more than 80%-or approximately 230 000-of the
cervical cancer deaths that occur each year can be averted.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of two deformable image
registration algorithms by examining their influence on the dose summation
results obtained using 4DCT (four dimensional computed tomography) dose
distributions based on '4D' planned and '4D optimal' IMRT (intensity modulated
radiation therapy) plans. For ten lung cancer patients, 4D step and shoot IMRT
plans were produced. The breathing cycle was divided into ten parts and for each 
part a set of CT images was acquired. For each patient the treatment plan was
copied to the CTs of each phase and subsequently recalculated. Each phase CT was 
then registered to the average intensity projection (AIP) CT using a deformable
image registration (DIR) algorithm and the composite dose distribution was then
calculated by summing up the deformed dose distributions from all the phases
('4D' treatment plan). The '4D optimal' treatment plan was created by producing
an optimal plan on the CTs of each phase of the respiratory cycle and summing up 
the deformed dose distributions from all the phases. The results indicate that it
is possible to map the dose distributions of different breathing phases in lung
using DIR, and that different DIR methods and target characteristics (motion
amplitude, size, location) affect the differences between original plan, '4D' and
'4D optimal' dose distributions. Although the '4D optimal' plans were designed to
achieve 95% target coverage, both of the used DIR methods failed to translate
that coverage in some instances. The same variation between these methods was
also observed in the '4D' plan comparison. This study shows that it is feasible
to perform an acceptably accurate calculation of the composite deformed dose.
However, it is important to account for tumor motion and body deformation
especially when the tumor volume is small and/or located in the lower lobe of the
lung.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric adenocarcinoma exhibits locally intense
inflammation but systemic manifestations are uncertain. Our study examined
whether circulating mediators of inflammation and immune response differ by tumor
EBV status. From a Latvian series of 302 gastric cancer cases, we measured plasma
levels of 92 immune-related proteins in the 28 patients with EBV-positive tumors 
and 34 patients with EBV-negative tumors. Eight markers were statistically
significantly higher with tumor EBV positivity: chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL) 
20 (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.6; p-trend = 0.001), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 (OR =
3.6; p-trend = 0.003), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; OR = 3.4; p-trend =
0.004), interleukin (IL)-10 (OR = 2.4; p-trend = 0.019), CCL19 (OR = 2.3; p-trend
= 0.019), CCL11 (OR = 2.2; p-trend = 0.026), IL-17A (OR = 2.0; p-trend = 0.038)
and CCL8 (OR = 1.9; p-trend = 0.049). Systemic responses to EBV-positive gastric 
cancer are characterized by alterations in chemokines and PD-L1. Profiling of
these molecules may enable non-invasive diagnosis of EBV status when tumor tissue
is unavailable. Our findings provide theoretical justification for clinical
evaluations of immune checkpoint therapy for EBV-positive gastric cancer.

Background There is currently a lack of consensus on how health-related quality
of life and other patient-reported outcome measures in cancer randomized clinical
trials are analyzed and interpreted. This makes it difficult to compare results
across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) synthesize scientific research, and
use that evidence to inform product labeling, clinical guidelines, and health
policy. The Setting International Standards in Analyzing Patient-Reported
Outcomes and Quality of Life Endpoints Data for Cancer Clinical Trials (SISAQOL) 
Consortium aims to develop guidelines and recommendations to standardize analyses
of patient-reported outcome data in cancer RCTs. Methods and Results Members from
the SISAQOL Consortium met in January 2017 to discuss relevant issues. Data from 
systematic reviews of the current state of published research in patient-reported
outcomes in cancer RCTs indicated a lack of clear reporting of research
hypothesis and analytic strategies, and inconsistency in definitions of terms,
including "missing data,""health-related quality of life," and "patient-reported 
outcome." Based on the meeting proceedings, the Consortium will focus on three
key priorities in the coming year: developing a taxonomy of research objectives, 
identifying appropriate statistical methods to analyze patient-reported outcome
data, and determining best practices to evaluate and deal with missing data.
Conclusion The quality of the Consortium guidelines and recommendations are
informed and enhanced by the broad Consortium membership which includes
regulators, patients, clinicians, and academics.

Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder
lacking effective therapies. AS is caused by mutations in ubiquitin protein
ligase E3A (UBE3A), which is genomically imprinted such that only the maternally 
inherited copy is expressed in neurons. We previously demonstrated that
topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors could successfully reactivate the dormant
paternal allele of Ube3a in neurons of a mouse model of AS. We also previously
showed that one such Top1 inhibitor, topotecan, could unsilence paternal UBE3A in
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with AS. Although 
topotecan has been well-studied and is FDA-approved for cancer therapy, its
limited CNS bioavailability will likely restrict the therapeutic use of topotecan
in AS. The goal of this study was to identify additional Top1 inhibitors with
similar efficacy as topotecan, with the expectation that these could be tested in
the future for safety and CNS bioavailability to assess their potential as AS
therapeutics.
Methods: We tested 13 indenoisoquinoline-derived Top1 inhibitors to identify
compounds that unsilence the paternal allele of Ube3a in mouse neurons. Primary
cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) mice with a
Ube3a-YFP fluorescent tag on the paternal allele (Ube3am+/pYFP mice) or mice that
lack the maternal Ube3a allele and hence model AS (Ube3am-/p+ mice). Neurons were
cultured for 7 days, treated with drug for 72 h, and examined for paternal UBE3A 
protein expression by Western blot or fluorescence immunostaining. Dose responses
of the compounds were determined across a log range of drug treatments, and
cytotoxicity was tested using a luciferase-based assay.
Results: All 13 indenoisoquinoline-derived Top1 inhibitors unsilenced paternal
Ube3a. Several compounds exhibited favorable paternal Ube3a unsilencing
properties, similar to topotecan, and of these, indotecan (LMP400) was the most
effective based on estimated Emax (maximum response of unsilencing paternal
Ube3a) and EC50 (half maximal effective concentration).
Conclusions: We provide pharmacological profiles of indenoisoquinoline-derived
Top1 inhibitors as paternal Ube3a unsilencers. All 13 tested compounds were
effective at unsilencing paternal Ube3a, although with variable efficacy and
potency. Indotecan (LMP400) demonstrated a better pharmacological profile of
Ube3a unsilencing compared to our previous lead compound, topotecan. Taken
together, indotecan and its structural analogues are potential AS therapeutics
whose translational potential in AS treatment should be further assessed.

Epidemiologic evidence for an association between alcohol and prostate cancer is 
mixed. Moreover, there is a lack of research investigating early-life alcohol
intake as a risk factor for either overall or high-grade prostate cancer. We
examined lifetime alcohol intake in association with prostate cancer diagnosis in
an equal-access, racially diverse prostate biopsy cohort. Men undergoing prostate
biopsy at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 2007 to 2018 completed 
a survey indicating average number of alcoholic beverages consumed per week
[categorized as none (ref), 1-6, ≥7] during each decade of life. Multivariable
logistic regression was used to test the association between alcohol intake
across decades and diagnosis of overall, low-grade [grade group (GG) 1-2] and
high-grade prostate cancer (GG 3-5). Of 650 men ages 49-89 who underwent biopsy, 
325 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 238 with low-grade and 88 with
high-grade disease. Relative to nondrinkers, men who consumed ≥7 drinks/week at
ages 15 to 19 had increased odds of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR =
3.21, P trend = 0.020), with similar findings for ages 20 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40
to 49. Consistent with these results, men in the upper tertile of cumulative
lifetime intake had increased odds of high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR = 
3.20, P trend = 0.003). In contrast, current alcohol intake was not associated
with prostate cancer. In conclusion, among men undergoing prostate biopsy,
heavier alcohol intake earlier in life and higher cumulative lifetime intake were
positively associated with high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis, while current
intake was unrelated to prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that earlier-life
alcohol intake should be explored as a potential risk factor for high-grade
prostate cancer. Cancer Prev Res; 11(10); 621-8. ©2018 AACR.

Context: Radioactive iodine (RAI) has been epidemiologically associated with the 
development of hematologic malignancies. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a precursor
clonal state that confers increased risk of leukemia and occurs at an elevated
rate in patients with thyroid cancer relative to other solid tumors.
Objective: We explore if the high prevalence of CH may be a result of RAI
exposure and whether CH may be a surrogate in the association between RAI and
leukemia.
Design: CH, CH-potential driver (CH-PD), and overall survival were evaluated in
279 patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma.
Results: The prevalence of CH in patients with thyroid cancer was 37%, and that
of CH-PD was 5.2%. Age was the strongest predictor of CH and CH-PD. For every
year increase in age, there was a 5% and 13% increase in the odds of CH and
CH-PD, respectively. RAI dose was significantly associated with CH and CH-PD,
even after adjustment for age, external beam radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
For every 10 mCi increase in the dose of RAI administered, there was a 2% and 4% 
increase in the odds of CH and CH-PD, respectively. Patients with CH-PD
previously exposed to RAI had a significantly poorer survival, even when
stratified by age (heart rate = 3.75, 95% CI = 1.23 to 11.5, P = 0.02).
Conclusions: RAI was associated with a high prevalence of CH, and CH is a
precursor state of hematologic malignancies. The implications of this study may
favor identification of CH in patients where the risks might outweigh the
benefits of receiving RAI therapy for thyroid cancer.

Human endogenous retroviruses (hERVs) are remnants of exogenous retroviruses that
have integrated into the genome throughout evolution. We developed a
computational workflow, hervQuant, which identified more than 3,000
transcriptionally active hERVs within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer
RNA-Seq database. hERV expression was associated with clinical prognosis in
several tumor types, most significantly clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). 
We explored two mechanisms by which hERV expression may influence the tumor
immune microenvironment in ccRCC: (i) RIG-I-like signaling and (ii) retroviral
antigen activation of adaptive immunity. We demonstrated the ability of hERV
signatures associated with these immune mechanisms to predict patient survival in
ccRCC, independent of clinical staging and molecular subtyping. We identified
potential tumor-specific hERV epitopes with evidence of translational activity
through the use of a ccRCC ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) dataset, validated their
ability to bind HLA in vitro, and identified the presence of MHC
tetramer-positive T cells against predicted epitopes. hERV sequences identified
through this screening approach were significantly more highly expressed in ccRCC
tumors responsive to treatment with programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)
inhibition. hervQuant provides insights into the role of hERVs within the tumor
immune microenvironment, as well as evidence that hERV expression could serve as 
a biomarker for patient prognosis and response to immunotherapy.

Although a subset of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients respond to 
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), predictors of response remain uncertain. We
investigated whether abnormal expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in
tumors is associated with local immune checkpoint activation (ICA) and response
to ICB. Twenty potentially immunogenic ERVs (πERVs) were identified in ccRCC in
The Cancer Genome Atlas data set, and tumors were stratified into 3 groups based 
on their expression levels. πERV-high ccRCC tumors showed increased immune
infiltration, checkpoint pathway upregulation, and higher CD8+ T cell fraction in
infiltrating leukocytes compared with πERV-low ccRCC tumors. Similar results were
observed in ER+/HER2- breast, colon, and head and neck squamous cell cancers. ERV
expression correlated with expression of genes associated with histone
methylation and chromatin regulation, and πERV-high ccRCC was enriched in BAP1
mutant tumors. ERV3-2 expression correlated with ICA in 11 solid cancers,
including the 4 named above. In a small retrospective cohort of 24 metastatic
ccRCC patients treated with single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, ERV3-2 expression
in tumors was significantly higher in responders compared with nonresponders.
Thus, abnormal expression of πERVs is associated with ICA in several solid
cancers, including ccRCC, and ERV3-2 expression is associated with response to
ICB in ccRCC.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases are a common cause of disabling neurologic
complications and death in patients with metastatic melanoma. Previous studies of
nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in metastatic melanoma have excluded patients 
with untreated brain metastases. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of
nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with melanoma who had untreated brain
metastases.
METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study, patients with metastatic
melanoma and at least one measurable, nonirradiated brain metastasis (tumor
diameter, 0.5 to 3 cm) and no neurologic symptoms received nivolumab (1 mg per
kilogram of body weight) plus ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 3 weeks for up
to four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg per kilogram) every 2 weeks until
progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary end point was the rate of 
intracranial clinical benefit, defined as the percentage of patients who had
stable disease for at least 6 months, complete response, or partial response.
RESULTS: Among 94 patients with a median follow-up of 14.0 months, the rate of
intracranial clinical benefit was 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47 to 68);
the rate of complete response was 26%, the rate of partial response was 30%, and 
the rate of stable disease for at least 6 months was 2%. The rate of extracranial
clinical benefit was 56% (95% CI, 46 to 67). Treatment-related grade 3 or 4
adverse events were reported in 55% of patients, including events involving the
central nervous system in 7%. One patient died from immune-related myocarditis.
The safety profile of the regimen was similar to that reported in patients with
melanoma who do not have brain metastases.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab combined with ipilimumab had clinically meaningful
intracranial efficacy, concordant with extracranial activity, in patients with
melanoma who had untreated brain metastases. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and

Thioridazine is an antipsychotic that has been shown to induce cell death and
inhibit self-renewal in a broad spectrum of cancer cells. The mechanisms by which
these effects are mediated are currently unknown but are presumed to result from 
the inhibition of dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2). Here we show that the self-renewal 
of several, but not all, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines is inhibited by
thioridazine. The inhibition of self-renewal by thioridazine in these cells is
mediated by DRD2 inhibition. Further, we demonstrate that DRD2 promotes
self-renewal in these cells via a STAT3- and IL-6-dependent mechanism. We also
show that thioridazine induces a G1 arrest and a loss in cell viability in all
tested cell lines. However, the reduction in proliferation and cell viability is 
independent of DRD2 and STAT3. Our results indicate that although there are cell 
types in which DRD2 inhibition results in inhibition of STAT3 and self-renewal,
the dramatic block in cancer cell proliferation across many cell lines caused by 
thioridazine treatment is independent of DRD2 inhibition.

BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic impact of three inflammatory
markers - neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and 
lymphocyte monocyte ratio (LMR) - on overall survival (OS) in older adults with
cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our sample includes 144 patients age ≥ 65 years with solid
tumor cancer who completed a cancer-specific Geriatric Assessment (GA) from 2010 
to 2014 and had pretreatment CBC with differential. NLR was dichotomized a
previously reported cut-off value of 3.5, while PLR and LMR were dichotomized at 
the median. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated whether NLR, PLR and LMR
were predictive of OS independent of covariates including a recently developed
3-item GA-derived prognostic scale consisting of (1) "limitation in walking
several blocks", (2) "limitation in shopping", and (3) "≥ 5% unintentional weight
loss in 6 months".
RESULTS: Median age was 72 years, 53% had breast cancer, 27% had stage 4 cancer, 
14% had Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) < 80, 11% received less intensive than
standard treatment for stage, and 39% had NLR > 3.5. In univariable analysis,
higher NLR and PLR and lower LMR were significantly associated with worse OS. NLR
remained a significant predictor of OS (HR = 2.16, 95% CI; 1.10-4.25, p = .025)
after adjusting for cancer type, stage, age, KPS, treatment intensity, and the
GA-derived prognostic scale.
CONCLUSION: NLR > 3.5 is predictive of poorer OS in older adults with cancer,
independent of traditional prognostic factors and the GA-derived prognostic
scale.

Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) requires sustained suppression of
tumor cell growth and metastasis for long-term efficacy. However, traditional
intratumoral drug delivery system always exhibits burst release with less
therapeutic outcomes. Here, a new self-assembling amphiphilic peptide drug
conjugate (SAAPDC) is fabricated as a "two-in-one" nanofiber system comprising a 
hexapeptide as a matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) inhibitor and doxorubicin (DOX) 
for the treatment of HCC. The results indicate that doxorubicin-conjugated
peptide (DOX-KGFRWR) self-assembles to form long nanofibers showing sustained
release property for inhibiting the enzymatic activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9. This
nanofiber not only inhibits tumor growth in situ but also effectively prevents
pulmonary metastasis in an SMMC7721 cell line-based mouse model. In summary, this
hexapeptide-based supermolecule system represents a promising nanoscale platform 
to sustain drug release with high loading capacity for intratumoral
administration. Moreover, the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs via drug-bearing
supramolecular MMP inhibitor nanofibers simultaneously inhibits metastasis and
tumor growth to achieve synergistic effects for metastatic HCC therapy.

Cancer-derived loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 tumor suppressor gene
stabilize the NRF2 transcription factor, resulting in a pro-survival gene
expression program that alters cellular metabolism and neutralizes oxidative
stress. In a recent genotype-phenotype study, we classified 40% of KEAP1
mutations as ANCHOR mutants. By immunoprecipitation, these mutants bind more NRF2
than wild-type KEAP1 and ubiquitylate NRF2, but are incapable of promoting NRF2
degradation. BioID-based protein interaction studies confirmed increased
abundance of NRF2 within the KEAP1 ANCHOR mutant complexes with no other
statistically significant changes to the complexes. Discrete molecular dynamic
simulation modeling and limited proteolysis suggest that the ANCHOR mutations
stabilize residues in KEAP1 that contact NRF2. The modeling supports an
intramolecular salt bridge between the R470C ANCHOR mutation and E493; mutation
of the E493 residue confirmed the model, resulting in the ANCHOR phenotype. In
live cells, the KEAP1 R320Q and R470C ANCHOR mutants co-localize with NRF2,
p62/SQSTM1, and polyubiquitin in structured spherical droplets that rapidly fuse 
and dissolve. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with confocal fluorescent 
imaging revealed membraneless phase-separated biomolecular condensates. We
present a model wherein ANCHOR mutations form p62-dependent biomolecular
condensates that may represent a transitional state between impaired proteasomal 
degradation and autophagy.

OBJECTIVES: To examine longitudinal symptoms, mobility and function, and quality 
of life (QOL) in adults newly diagnosed with acute leukemia.
SAMPLE &AMP; SETTING: 55 adults undergoing induction chemotherapy at the
University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Duke 
Cancer Institute.
METHODS &AMP; VARIABLES: A prospective, longitudinal study with measures of
mobility and function, global physical and mental health, cancer-related fatigue,
anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, pain intensity, and leukemia-specific QOL
was conducted. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, linear mixed
modeling, and one-way analysis of variance.
RESULTS: 49 adults with acute leukemia completed assessments during
hospitalizations. Global mental health and pain intensity did not change
significantly. Global physical health significantly improved. Fatigue, anxiety,
depression, and sleep disturbance decreased significantly. QOL increased
significantly.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The significant decrease in anxiety and fatigue during 
hospitalization may be attributable to understanding of the disease process,
familiarity with the staff, and ability to communicate concerns.

T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) mediate both
antitumor immunity (graft-versus-leukemia [GVL]) and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) in allogeneic stem cell transplant. Identifying mHAs with high allele
frequency, tight binding affinity to common HLA molecules, and narrow tissue
restriction could enhance immunotherapy against leukemia. Genotyping and HLA
allele data from 101 HLA-matched donor-recipient pairs (DRPs) were
computationally analyzed to predict both class I and class II mHAs likely to
induce either GVL or GVHD. Roughly twice as many mHAs were predicted in
HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared with
HLA-matched related transplants, an expected result given greater genetic
disparity in MUD SCT. Computational analysis predicted 14 of 18 previously
identified mHAs, with 2 minor antigen mismatches not being contained in the
patient cohort, 1 missed mHA resulting from a noncanonical translation of the
peptide antigen, and 1 case of poor binding prediction. A predicted peptide
epitope derived from GRK4, a protein expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and
testis, was confirmed by targeted differential ion mobility spectrometry-tandem
mass spectrometry. T cells specific to UNC-GRK4-V were identified by tetramer
analysis both in DRPs where a minor antigen mismatch was predicted and in DRPs
where the donor contained the allele encoding UNC-GRK4-V, suggesting that this
antigen could be both an mHA and a cancer-testis antigen. Computational analysis 
of genomic and transcriptomic data can reliably predict leukemia-associated mHA
and can be used to guide targeted mHA discovery.

INTRODUCTION: The incidence of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) in
younger adults has rapidly increased over the past two decades. While tobacco and
alcohol use may be less likely to cause these tumors, it remains controversial
whether differences also exist in their prognosis. Our aim is to examine the risk
factors for cancer among young (<45 years old) OTSCC patients at our institution,
and to compare their recurrence and survival with older patients in a matched
cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All OTSCC patients seen at our institution between 2000
and 2015 were reviewed. Patients under 45 who with sufficient treatment
information were matched 1:1 on race, T-stage, and N-stage with patients 45 and
older. Three-year recurrence and survival were determined in stratified and
adjusted Cox regression models.
RESULTS: Of 397 OTSCC patients were seen at our institution, 117 (29%) were less 
than 45 years old. Younger patients were significantly more likely to be female, 
(50% vs. 39%; p = 0.04) and to abstain from tobacco (51% vs. 39%; p < 0.01).
Young patients in the matched cohort were significantly more likely to have a
recurrence (HR 3.9 95% CI 1.4-10.5). There was no difference in overall survival.
CONCLUSION: Younger OTSCC patients in a matched cohort were more likely to recur 
within 3 years, although there was no difference in overall mortality.
Differences in risk factors and recurrence between older and younger patients
suggest that some cancer among younger patients may be distinct from traditional 
OTSCC.

BACKGROUND: Although induction studies of TPF in SCCHN have not improved outcomes
compared to chemoradiotherapy alone, phase II studies of weekly carboplatin
(CbP), paclitaxel and cetuximab (C225) have shown promising results.
Nano-albumin-paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) based chemotherapy has demonstrated a
higher response rate (RR) than solvent-based paclitaxel in squamous cell
carcinoma of the lung with favorable toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with treatment naïve SCCHN of any site with ≥N2b 
disease or that was unresectable by strict criteria were eligible. Patients were 
treated with nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2, CbP area under the curve (AUC) 2 and C225 
400 mg/m2 week 1 then 250 mg/m2 for six weeks, followed by standard of care
chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The primary endpoint was clinical response rate to
induction therapy as defined by RECIST version 1.1. Secondary measures included
toxicity, progression-free survival, overall survival and quality of life as
measured by FACT-HN.
RESULTS: 38 eligible subjects were treated. Primary sites were: oropharynx (OPX) 
(25), larynx (3) oral cavity (OC) (9), hypopharynx (1). The most common grade 3
or 4 toxicity during induction was acneiform rash (26%) followed by neutropenia
(16%). RR was 76.3%. Median PFS and OS have not been reached (median follow-up of
3.3 years); they were superior in patients with response.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of nab-paclitaxel, CbP and C225 is feasible,
tolerable and active against locally advanced SCCHN.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection provides the only potentially curative treatment
of pancreatic cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation (NAT) is used to 
downstage patients with borderline resectable tumors. The objective of this study
was to examine the postoperative morbidity and mortality of NAT after
pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).
METHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality
Improvement Project Targeted Pancreatectomy data, we identified patients who
underwent a PD for PDA from 2014 to 2015. Patients were grouped by receipt of NAT
90 days before PD. Bivariable and multivariable analyses was used to compare
postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 3748 patients with PDA underwent PD; 926 (24.7%) received
NAT. Those in the NAT group had more major vein resections, and longer operating 
times (all P < 0.001). On pathologic staging, those in the NAT group had smaller 
tumors (T1, 10.9% vs 5.1%; P < 0.001) and fewer nodes positive (N0, 49% vs 28%;
P < 0.001). There were no differences in 30-day postoperative mortality or
overall complications. On multivariable analysis, patients who received NAT had a
lower likelihood of pancreatic fistula (OR, 0.67; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: NAT does not increase the overall postoperative morbidity or
mortality of PD for PDA. There is a decreased likelihood of pancreatic fistulas
in patients that receive neoadjuvant therapy.

BACKGROUND: Conditional reprogramming has enabled the development of long-lived, 
normal epithelial cell lines from mice and humans by in vitro culture with ROCK
inhibitor on a feeder layer. We applied this technology to mouse small intestine 
to create 2D mouse intestinal epithelial monolayers (IEC monolayers) from genetic
mouse models for functional analysis.
RESULTS: IEC monolayers form epithelial colonies that proliferate on a feeder
cell layer and are able to maintain their genotype over long-term passage. IEC
monolayers form 3D spheroids in matrigel culture and monolayers on transwell
inserts making them useful for functional analyses. IEC monolayers derived from
the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) mouse model CFTR ∆F508 fail to respond to CFTR activator
forskolin in 3D matrigel culture as measured by spheroid swelling and transwell
monolayer culture via Ussing chamber electrophysiology. Tumor IEC monolayers
generated from the ApcMin/+ mouse intestinal cancer model grow more quickly than 
wild-type (WT) IEC monolayers both on feeders and as spheroids in matrigel
culture.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that generation of IEC monolayers is a useful
model system for growing large numbers of genotype-specific mouse intestinal
epithelial cells that may be used in functional studies to examine molecular
mechanisms of disease and to identify and assess novel therapeutic compounds.

DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) occur more than 10,000 times per mammalian cell
each day, representing the most common type of DNA damage. Unrepaired SSBs
compromise DNA replication and transcription programs, leading to genome
instability. Unrepaired SSBs are associated with diseases such as cancer and
neurodegenerative disorders. Although canonical SSB repair pathway is activated
to repair most SSBs, it remains unclear whether and how unrepaired SSBs are
sensed and signaled. In this review, we propose a new concept of SSB end
resection for genome integrity. We propose a four-step mechanism of SSB end
resection: SSB end sensing and processing, as well as initiation, continuation,
and termination of SSB end resection. We also compare different mechanisms of SSB
end resection and DSB end resection in DNA repair and DNA damage response (DDR)
pathways. We further discuss how SSB end resection contributes to SSB signaling
and repair. We focus on the mechanism and regulation by APE2 in SSB end resection
in genome integrity. Finally, we identify areas of future study that may help us 
gain further mechanistic insight into the process of SSB end resection. Overall, 
this review provides the first comprehensive perspective on SSB end resection in 
genome integrity.

Proper patterning of the nervous system requires that developing axons find
appropriate postsynaptic partners; this entails microns to meters of extension
through an extracellular milieu exhibiting a wide range of mechanical and
chemical properties. Thus, the elaborate networks of fiber tracts and
non-fasciculated axons evident in mature organisms are formed via complex
pathfinding. The macroscopic structures of axon projections are highly
stereotyped across members of the same species, indicating precise mechanisms
guide their formation. The developing axon exhibits directionally biased growth
toward or away from external guidance cues. One of the most studied guidance cues
is netrin-1, however, its presentation in vivo remains debated. Guidance cues can
be secreted to form soluble or chemotactic gradients or presented bound to cells 
or the extracellular matrix to form haptotactic gradients. The growth cone, a
highly specialized dynamic structure at the end of the extending axon, detects
these guidance cues via transmembrane receptors, such as the netrin-1 receptors
deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and UNC5. These receptors orchestrate
remodeling of the cytoskeleton and cell membrane through both chemical and
mechanotransductive pathways, which result in traction forces generated by the
cytoskeleton against the extracellular environment and translocation of the
growth cone. Through intracellular signaling responses, netrin-1 can trigger
either attraction or repulsion of the axon. Here we review the mechanisms by
which the classical guidance cue netrin-1 regulates intracellular effectors to
respond to the extracellular environment in the context of axon guidance during
development of the central nervous system and discuss recent findings that
demonstrate the critical importance of mechanical forces in this process.

PURPOSE: Advanced pancreatic cancer is a highly refractory disease almost always 
associated with survival of little more than a year. New interventions based on
novel targets are needed. We aim to identify new genetic determinants of overall 
survival (OS) in patients after treatment with gemcitabine using genome-wide
screens of germline DNA. We aim also to support these findings with in vitro
functional analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide screens of germline DNA in two independent
cohorts of pancreatic cancer patients (from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) 80303 and the Mayo Clinic) were used to select new genes associated with 
OS. The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) was selected, and the interactions of
genetic variation in VDR with circulating vitamin D levels and gemcitabine
treatment were evaluated. Functional effects of common VDR variants were also
evaluated in experimental assays in human cell lines.
RESULTS: The rs2853564 variant in VDR was associated with OS in patients from
both the Mayo Clinic (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94, p = 0.0059) and CALGB 80303 (HR 
0.74, 0.63-0.87, p = 0.0002). rs2853564 interacted with high pre-treatment levels
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, a measure of endogenous vitamin D) (p = 0.0079
for interaction) and with gemcitabine treatment (p = 0.024 for interaction) to
confer increased OS. rs2853564 increased transcriptional activity in luciferase
assays and reduced the binding of the IRF4 transcription factor.
CONCLUSION: Our findings propose VDR as a novel determinant of survival in
advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Common functional variation in this gene
might interact with endogenous vitamin D and gemcitabine treatment to determine
improved patient survival. These results support evidence for a modulatory role
of the vitamin D pathway for the survival of advanced pancreatic cancer patients.

Alangium longiflorum is currently in extinction crisis, which will likely
severely hamper further phytochemical investigation of this plant species from
new collections. A crude extract of leaves of A. longiflorum (N33539), collected 
for the U.S. National Cancer Institute in 1989, showed potent cancer cell line
antiproliferative activity. A phytochemical study resulted in the isolation of 17
secondary metabolites, including two new tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids,
8-hydroxytubulosine (1) and 2'- O- trans-sinapoylisoalangiside (2), as well as a 
new sinapolyloxylupene derivative (3). Using in-house assays and NCI-60 panel
screening, compound 1 displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity at
submicromolar levels against most tested tumor cell lines, except for
drug-transporter-overexpressing cells. Compound 1 caused accumulation of sub-G1
cells with no effect on cell cycle progression, suggesting that this substance is
an apoptosis inducer.

Importance: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that shared decision
making (SDM) involving a thorough discussion of benefits and harms should occur
between clinicians and patients before initiating lung cancer screening (LCS)
with low-dose computed tomography. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
require an SDM visit using a decision aid as a prerequisite for LCS coverage.
However, little is known about how SDM about LCS occurs in practice.
Objective: To assess the quality of SDM about the initiation of LCS in clinical
practice.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A qualitative content analysis was performed
of transcribed conversations between primary care or pulmonary care physicians
and 14 patients presumed to be eligible for LCS, recorded between April 1, 2014, 
and March 1, 2018, that were identified within a large database.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Independent observer ratings of communication
behaviors of physicians using the OPTION (Observing Patient Involvement in
Decision Making) scale, a validated 12-item measure of SDM (total score, 0-100
points, where 0 indicates no evidence of SDM and 100 indicates evidence of SDM at
the highest skill level); time spent discussing LCS during visits; and evidence
of decision aid use.
Results: A total of 14 conversations about initiating LCS were identified; 9
patients were women, and 5 patients were men; the mean (SD) patient age was 63.9 
(5.1) years; 7 patients had Medicare, and 8 patients were current smokers. Half
the conversations were conducted by primary care physicians. The mean total
OPTION score for the 14 LCS conversations was 6 on a scale of 0 to 100 (range,
0-17). None of the conversations met the minimum skill criteria for 8 of the 12
SDM behaviors. Physicians universally recommended LCS. Discussion of harms (such 
as false positives and their sequelae or overdiagnosis) was virtually absent. The
mean total visit length of a discussion was 13:07 minutes (range, 3:48-27:09
minutes). The mean time spent discussing LCS was 0:59 minute (range, 0:16-2:19
minutes), or 8% of the total visit time (range, 1%-18%). There was no evidence
that decision aids or other patient education materials for LCS were used.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this small sample of recorded encounters about
initiating LCS, the observed quality of SDM was poor and explanation of potential
harms of screening was virtually nonexistent. Time spent discussing LCS was
minimal, and there was no evidence that decision aids were used. Although these
findings are preliminary, they raise concerns that SDM for LCS in practice may be
far from what is intended by guidelines.

Checkpoint immunotherapy uses highly selective humanized monoclonal antibodies
against checkpoint signals such as programmed cell death receptor (PD-1) and
programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1). By blocking these receptors and signals,
the immune system can be reactivated to fight the tumor. Immunotherapy for
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has resulted in a new paradigm of
treatment options resulting in improved survival and response rates and has a
less severe yet unique toxicity profile when compared to chemotherapy. PD-1
inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, and PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab, are
currently approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.
This article provides a detailed review of these newer agents, their mechanism of
action, side-effect profile, therapeutic indications and current evidence
supporting their use in the management of NSCLC.

Background: We undertook this study to identify patients with Parkinson disease
(PD) with no or rare falls who may progress to frequent falling by their next
annual follow-up visit.
Methods: We analyzed data in the National Parkinson Foundation Quality
Improvement Initiative database to identify factors predicting which patients
with PD with no or rare falls at the baseline visit will report at least monthly 
falls at the annual follow-up visit. Multivariable models were constructed using 
logistic regression. Variables were introduced in 4 blocks: in the 1st block,
variables present at or before the baseline visit were entered; in the 2nd,
baseline visit assessments; in the 3rd, interventions implemented during baseline
visit; and, in the 4th block, changes in comorbidities, living situation, and
treatment between visits.
Results: Of 3,795 eligible participants, 3,276 (86.3%) reported no or rare falls 
at baseline visit, and of them, 382 (11.7%) reported at least monthly falls at
follow-up visit. Predictors included female sex, <90% diagnostic certainty, motor
fluctuations, levodopa treatment, antidepressant treatment, prior deep brain
stimulation (DBS), worse quality of life, Hoehn & Yahr stage 2 or 3, worse
semantic fluency, and, between visits, addition of amantadine, referral to
occupational therapy, social services, or DBS, new diagnoses of cancer or
osteoarthritis, and increased emergency visits.
Conclusions: This large-scale analysis identified several predictors of
progression to falling in PD. Such identifiers may help target patient subgroups 
for falls prevention intervention. Some factors are modifiable, offering
opportunities for developing such interventions.

PURPOSE: To estimate the radiobiological parameters of three popular NTCP models,
which describe the dose-response relations of carotid blowout syndrome (CBOS)
after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). To evaluate the goodness-of-fit and 
the correlation of those models with CBOS.
METHODS: The study included 61 patients with inoperable locally recurrent head
and neck cancer treated with SBRT using CyberKnife (Accuray, Sunnyvale, CA) at
the Department of Radiation Oncology, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey
between June 2007 and March 2011. The dose-volume histograms of the internal
carotid were exported from the plans of all the patients. The follow-up results
regarding the end point of carotid blowout syndrome were collected
retrospectively. Initially, univariable analyses (Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-square
tests) and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed between the
outcome data and a list of clinical and treatment factors to identify significant
correlations. Additionally, the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB), Relative Seriality
(RS), and Logit NTCP models were used to fit the clinical data. The fitting of
the different models was assessed through the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Odds Ratio
methods.
RESULTS: The clinical/treatment factors that were found to have a significant or 
close to significant correlations with acute CBOS were Age at the time of CK
(P-value = 0.03), Maximum carotid dose (P-value = 0.06), and CK prescription dose
(P-value = 0.08). Using Dmax , physical DVH, and EQD2 Gy -DVH as the dosimetric
metrics in the NTCP models, the derived LKB model parameters were: (a) D50
 = 45.8 Gy, m = 0.24, n = n/a; (b) D50  = 44.8 Gy, m = 0.28, n = 0.01; and (c)
D50  = 115.8 Gy, m = 0.45, n = 0.01, respectively. The AUC values for the
dosimetric metrics were 0.70, 0.68, and 0.61, respectively. The differences in
AIC between the different models were less than 2 and ranged within ±0.9.
CONCLUSION: The maximum dose to the internal carotid less than 34 Gy appears to
significantly reduce the risk for CBOS. Age at the time of CK, Maximum carotid
dose, and CK prescription dose were also found to correlate with CBOS. The values
of the parameters of three NTCP models were determined for this endpoint. A
threshold of gEUD <34.5 Gy appears to be significantly associated with lower
risks of CBOS.

Neoplastic cellularity contributes to the analytic sensitivity of most present
technologies for mutation detection, such that they underperform when stroma and 
inflammatory cells dilute a cancer specimen's variant fraction. Thus, tumor
purity assessment by light microscopy is used to determine sample adequacy before
sequencing and to interpret the significance of negative results and mutant
allele fraction afterwards. However, pathologist estimates of tumor purity are
imprecise and have limited reproducibility. With the advent of massively parallel
sequencing, large amounts of molecular data can be analyzed by computational
purity algorithms. We retrospectively compared tumor purity of 3 computational
algorithms with neoplastic cellularity using hematoxylin and eosin light
microscopy to determine which was best for clinical evaluation of molecular
profiling. Data were analyzed from 881 cancer patients from a clinical trial
cohort, LCCC1108 (UNCseq), whose tumors had targeted massively parallel
sequencing. Concordance among algorithms was poor, and the specimens analyzed had
high rates of algorithm failure partially due to variable tumor purity.
Computational tumor purity estimates did not add value beyond the pathologist's
estimate of neoplastic cellularity microscopy. To improve present methods, we
propose a semiquantitative, clinically applicable strategy based on mutant allele
fraction and copy number changes present within a given specimen, which when
combined with the morphologic tumor purity estimate, guide the interpretation of 
next-generation sequencing results in cancer patients.This is an open-access

Global cancer centres operate across different sizes, scales, and ecosystems.
Understanding the essential aspects of the creation, organisation, accreditation,
and activities within these settings is crucial for developing an affordable,
equitable, and quality cancer care, research, and education system. Robust
guidelines are scarce for cancer units, cancer centres, and comprehensive cancer 
centres in low-income and middle-income countries. However, some robust examples 
of the delivery of complex cancer care in centres in emerging economies are
available. Although it is impossible to create an optimal system to fit the
unique needs of all countries for the delivery of cancer care, we summarise what 
has been published about the development and management of cancer centres in
low-income and middle-income countries so far and highlight the need for clinical
and political leadership.

PURPOSE: To improve assessment of symptomatic toxicity in cancer clinical trials 
and complement clinician-based toxicity reporting, the US National Cancer
Institute developed a measurement system called the Patient-Reported Outcomes
version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE). The
objective of this study was to examine the content validity of PRO-CTCAE in
patients undergoing radiation therapy and to establish anatomic site-specific
item sets for implementation in cancer research.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients receiving radiation to the brain, head and neck, 
breast, thorax, abdomen, or pelvis were recruited during the final week of
radiation. Participants described side effects qualitatively and completed
anatomic site-specific checklists indicating the presence or absence of
symptomatic toxicities drawn from the PRO-CTCAE library. Items endorsed by ≥20%
of participants were selected for inclusion. Symptomatic toxicities described
qualitatively were content analyzed and summarized. Symptomatic toxicities not
reflected in the PRO-CTCAE item library were tabulated.
RESULTS: We conducted 389 interviews of patients receiving radiation to the brain
(n = 46), head and neck (n = 69), breast (n = 134), thorax (n = 30), abdomen (n =
27), female pelvis (n = 36), or male pelvis (n = 47). Median age was 62 years;
62% were female. The 53 solicited PRO-CTCAE symptoms reflected all reported
radiation-induced toxicities with the exception of phlegm/mucus production and
mouth/throat pain with swallowing in patients receiving head and neck radiation, 
eye dryness/irritation in patients undergoing brain radiation, and obstructive
urinary symptoms in men receiving pelvic radiation. The PRO-CTCAE items "skin
burns" and "pain" require greater specificity to adequately reflect toxicities
experienced during radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: PRO-CTCAE demonstrates strong content validity as a measure of
symptomatic toxicities in patients receiving radiation. These results provide
empirical support for the definition of site-specific PRO-CTCAE item sets to
assess the symptomatic toxicities of radiation therapy. The site-specific
PRO-CTCAE item sets developed herein are currently being deployed in our
department via an electronic platform to capture treatment-related toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer survivors who receive androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. They require coordinated
care between cancer specialist and primary care physicians (PCPs) to monitor for 
cancer control and manage cardiovascular risk factors.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 103 men receiving ADT with radiotherapy from 7
institutions to assess cardiovascular risk factors and survivorship care. Medical
records, fasting labs, and patient-reported outcomes using a validated instrument
were assessed at baseline (pre-treatment) and 1 year post-RT.
RESULTS: Cardiovascular disease (39%) and risk factors (diabetes 22%,
hypertension 63%, hyperlipidemia 31%) were prevalent at baseline. During the
first year after RT completion, 63% received cardiovascular monitoring concordant
with American Heart Association guidelines. Fasting labs at 1 year showed 24%
with inadequately controlled blood sugar, and 22% elevated cholesterol. Patient
perceptions about care coordination were relatively low. At 1 year, 57% reported 
that their PCP "always know about the care I receive at other places," 67%
reported that their cancer physician "communicated with other providers I see,"
and 65% reported the cancer physician "knows the results of my visits with other 
doctors."
CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer patients who receive ADT and RT are a vulnerable
population with prevalent baseline cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and
suboptimal survivorship care specifically related to coordinated care and
cardiovascular monitoring. Clinical trials examining ways to improve the care and
outcomes of these survivors are needed.

Comparative Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Treatment Options: Limitations of
Retrospective Analysis of Cancer Registry Data.

PURPOSE: Retrospective analyses of cancer registry and institutional data have
consistently found better survival after radical prostatectomy versus radiation
therapy, which contrasts with findings from a randomized trial. This is likely
because of the inability of retrospective studies to fully account for
comorbidity differences across treatment groups because of the lack of detailed
data in the registries. We use a unique population-based data set with detailed
data regarding comorbidities and functional limitations to assess whether this
can provide valid comparisons of survival across prostate cancer treatment
groups.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data set results from a linkage
between the SEER database and the MHOS database, which includes detailed
information regarding patient-reported comorbidity and functional limitations. We
analyzed 3102 patients with prostate cancer in SEER-MHOS and used latent class
analysis to identify the healthiest group with minimal comorbidity burden and
functional limitations. Among the healthiest group, we examined overall survival 
across treatments using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Three distinct health groups were identified using latent class
analysis; the healthiest group comprised 57% of the cohort and had a 10-year
overall survival of 67%. Other health groups had higher rates of comorbidities or
functional limitations. Among the healthiest group, 10-year overall survival
differed across treatment groups: no local treatment (55%), external beam
radiation therapy (69%), brachytherapy (76%), and radical prostatectomy (85%).
Survival curves for the 3 treated groups separated at 4 years of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the detailed health status information available in
SEER-MHOS, our retrospective analysis could not fully account for patient
selection biases across prostate cancer treatment groups. These findings
highlight an important limitation of retrospective studies using population-based
data sets and serve as a reminder to interpret results with caution.

OBJECTIVE: The anti-cancer anthracycline drug Doxorubicin (Dox) causes
cardiotoxicity. We investigated the role of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1)
in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that PAR-1 enhanced
Dox-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and cell death of 
cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. The contribution of PAR-1 to
Dox-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated by subjecting PAR-1-/- mice and
PAR-1+/+ mice to acute and chronic exposure to Dox. Heart function was measured
by echocardiography. PAR-1-/- mice exhibited significant less cardiac injury and 
dysfunction compared to PAR-1+/+ mice after acute and chronic Dox administration.
PAR-1-/- mice had reduced levels of nitrotyrosine, apoptosis and inflammation in 
their heart compared to PAR-1+/+ mice. Furthermore, inhibition of PAR-1 in
wild-type mice with vorapaxar significantly reduced the acute Dox-induced
cardiotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of PAR-1 contributes to
Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of PAR-1 may be a new approach to reduce
Dox-induced cardiotoxicity in cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic women are more likely to
report pain, depression, and other mental health concerns. However, little is
known about Hispanic women's use of supportive medications, and whether use
differs depending on nativity (US- vs. foreign-born). This study's objectives
were to examine patterns of supportive medication use and investigate potential
differences by ethnicity/nativity among women with breast cancer.
METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked with
Medicare claims to identify women diagnosed with incident breast cancer between
July 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011. Supportive medication use (opioid pain and
non-opioid psychotropic medications) in the 90 days after diagnosis was the
primary outcome. We categorized ethnicity/nativity as US-Born non-Hispanic,
US-born Hispanic, foreign-born non-Hispanic, and foreign-born Hispanic. Modified 
Poisson models examined associations between ethnicity/nativity and medication
use, adjusting for tumor, treatment, and demographic characteristics.
RESULTS: We included 23,091 women, of whom 88% were US-born non-Hispanics, 4%
US-born Hispanics, 6% foreign-born non-Hispanics, and 2% foreign-born Hispanics. 
Supportive medication use varied by ethnicity/nativity. Compared to US-born
non-Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics and non-Hispanics were 5% (95% CI
0.92-0.98) and 10% (95% CI 0.85-0.96) less likely to receive supportive
medications, respectively. US-born Hispanics were 5% (95% CI 1.02-1.09) more
likely to receive supportive medications. Observed differences persisted when
analyses were limited to stage I-III breast cancer cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights potential disparities in the pharmacologic
treatment of psychosocial needs of foreign-born breast cancer patients. Future
studies should explore if differences observed here are reflective of health
disparities or differential patient preferences.

BACKGROUND: The Musashi (MSI) family of RNA-binding proteins is best known for
the role in post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. Elevated MSI1 levels
in a variety of human cancer are associated with up-regulation of Notch/Wnt
signaling. MSI1 binds to and negatively regulates translation of Numb and APC
(adenomatous polyposis coli), negative regulators of Notch and Wnt signaling
respectively.
METHODS: Previously, we have shown that the natural product (-)-gossypol as the
first known small molecule inhibitor of MSI1 that down-regulates Notch/Wnt
signaling and inhibits tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Using a fluorescence
polarization (FP) competition assay, we identified gossypolone (Gn) with
a > 20-fold increase in Ki value compared to (-)-gossypol. We validated Gn
binding to MSI1 using surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and 
cellular thermal shift assay, and tested the effects of Gn on colon cancer cells 
and colon cancer DLD-1 xenografts in nude mice.
RESULTS: In colon cancer cells, Gn reduced Notch/Wnt signaling and induced
apoptosis. Compared to (-)-gossypol, the same concentration of Gn is less active 
in all the cell assays tested. To increase Gn bioavailability, we used PEGylated 
liposomes in our in vivo studies. Gn-lip via tail vein injection inhibited the
growth of human colon cancer DLD-1 xenografts in nude mice, as compared to the
untreated control (P < 0.01, n = 10).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that PEGylation improved the bioavailability of Gn
as well as achieved tumor-targeted delivery and controlled release of Gn, which
enhanced its overall biocompatibility and drug efficacy in vivo. This provides
proof of concept for the development of Gn-lip as a molecular therapy for colon
cancer with MSI1/MSI2 overexpression.

BACKGROUND: Black women with endometrial cancer are more likely to die from their
disease compared to white women with endometrial cancer. These survival
disparities persist even when disproportionately worse tumor characteristics
among black women are accounted. Receipt of less complete adjuvant treatment
among black endometrial cancer patients could contribute to this disparity.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed the hypothesis that black women with endometrial cancer
are less likely than their white counterparts to receive adjuvant treatment
within subgroups defined by tumor characteristics in the NRG Oncology/Gynecology 
Oncology Group 210 Study.
STUDY DESIGN: Our analysis included 615 black and 4,283 white women with
endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy. Women completed a questionnaire
that assessed race and endometrial cancer risk factors. Tumor characteristics
were available from pathology reports and central review. We categorized women as
low-, intermediate-, or high-risk based on the European Society for Medical
Oncology definition. Adjuvant treatment was documented during postoperative
visits and was categorized as no adjuvant treatment (54.3%), radiotherapy only
(16.5%), chemotherapy only (15.2%), and radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (14.0%).
We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals for multivariable-adjusted associations between race and adjuvant
treatment in the overall study population and stratified by tumor subtype, stage,
or European Society for Medical Oncology risk category.
RESULTS: Overall, black women were more likely to have received chemotherapy-only
(odds ratio=1.40, 95% confidence interval=1.04-1.86) or radiotherapy plus
chemotherapy (odds ratio=2.01, 95% confidence interval=1.54-2.62) compared to
white women in multivariable-adjusted models. No racial difference in receipt of 
radiotherapy-only was observed. In tumor subtype-stratified models, black women
had higher odds of receiving radiotherapy plus chemotherapy than white women when
diagnosed with low-grade endometrioid (odds ratio=2.04, 95% confidence
interval=1.06-3.93) or serous tumors (odds ratio=1.81, 95% confidence
interval=1.07-3.08). Race was not associated with adjuvant treatment among women 
diagnosed with other tumor subtypes. In stage-stratified models we observed no
racial differences in receipt of adjuvant treatment. In models stratified by
European Society for Medical Oncology risk group, black women with high-risk
cancer were more likely to receive radiotherapy plus chemotherapy compared to
white women (odds ratio=1.41, 95% confidence interval=1.03-1.94).
CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis we observed higher odds of specific
adjuvant treatment regimens among black as compared to white women within
specific subgroups of endometrial cancer characteristics.

PURPOSE: For glioblastoma (GBM), imaging response (IR) or pseudoprogression (PSP)
is frequently observed after chemoradiation and may connote a favorable
prognosis. With tumors categorized by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project
(mesenchymal, classical, neural, and proneural) and by
methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, we attempted to
determine if certain genomic or molecular subtypes of GBM were specifically
associated with IR or PSP.
METHODS: Patients with GBM treated at two institutions were reviewed.
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS). Mantel-cox test determined effect of IR and PSP 
on OS and PFS. Fisher's exact test was utilized to correlate IR and PSP with
genomic subtypes and MGMT status.
RESULTS: Eighty-two patients with GBM were reviewed. The median OS and PFS were
17.9 months and 8.9 months. IR was observed in 28 (40%) and was associated with
improved OS (median 29.4 vs 14.5 months p < 0.01) and PFS (median 17.7 vs
5.5 months, p < 0.01). PSP was observed in 14 (19.2%) and trended towards
improved PFS (15.0 vs 7.7 months p = 0.08). Tumors with a proneural component had
a higher rate of IR compared to those without a proneural component (IR 60% vs
28%; p = 0.03). MGMT methylation was associated with IR (58% vs 24%, p = 0.032), 
but not PSP (34%, p = 0.10).
CONCLUSION: IR is associated with improved OS and PFS. The proneural subtype and 
MGMT methylated tumors had higher rates of IR.

The TAM (TYRO-3, AXL, MERTK) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play an
important role in promoting growth, survival, and metastatic spread of several
tumor types. AXL and MERTK are overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), malignancies that are highly metastatic and lethal. AXL is the
most well-characterized TAM receptor and mediates resistance to both conventional
and targeted cancer therapies. Since AXL is highly expressed in aggressive tumor 
types, cancer patients are currently being enrolled in clinical trials testing
AXL inhibitors. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of AXL inhibition
using a small molecule AXL inhibitor, monoclonal antibody therapy, and siRNA in
HNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models. Anti-AXL targeting strategies had
limited efficacy across these different models which our data suggests could be
attributed to upregulation of MERTK. MERTK expression was increased in cell lines
and patient-derived xenografts treated with AXL inhibitors and inhibition of
MERTK sensitized HNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models to AXL inhibition.
Dual targeting of AXL and MERTK led to a more potent blockade of downstream
signaling, synergistic inhibition of tumor cell expansion in culture, and reduced
tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of MERTK in AXL
inhibitor-sensitive models resulted in resistance to AXL-targeting strategies.
These observations suggest that therapeutic strategies co-targeting both AXL and 
MERTK could be highly beneficial in a variety of tumor types where both receptors
are expressed, leading to improved survival for patients with lethal
malignancies.

With more than 150,000 deaths per year in the US alone, lung cancer has the
highest number of deaths for any cancer. These poor outcomes reflect a lack of
treatment for the most common form of lung cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma 
(NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is the most prevalent subtype of NSCLC, with
the main oncogenic drivers being KRAS and epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR). Whereas EGFR blockade has led to some success in lung ADC, effective KRAS
inhibition is lacking. KRAS-mutant ADCs are characterized by high levels of
gel-forming mucin expression, with the highest mucin levels corresponding to
worse prognoses. Despite these well-recognized associations, little is known
about roles for individual gel-forming mucins in ADC development causatively. We 
hypothesized that MUC5AC/Muc5ac, a mucin gene known to be commonly expressed in
NSCLC, is crucial in KRAS/Kras-driven lung ADC. We found that MUC5AC was a
significant determinant of poor prognosis, especially in patients with
KRAS-mutant tumors. In addition, by using mice with lung ADC induced chemically
with urethane or transgenically by mutant-Kras expression, we observed
significantly reduced tumor development in animals lacking Muc5ac compared with
controls. Collectively, these results provide strong support for MUC5AC as a
potential therapeutic target for lung ADC, a disease with few effective
treatments.

Understanding how p53 activates certain gene programs and not others is critical.
Here, we identify low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a
transmembrane endocytic receptor, as a p53 target gene. We show that, although
LRP1 transcript expression is upregulated in response to both sub-lethal and
lethal doses of p53-activating stress, LRP1 protein is only upregulated in
response to sub-lethal stress. Interestingly, lethal doses of p53-activating
stress inhibit LRP1 de novo translation through an miRNA-based translational
repression mechanism. We show that the p53-regulated miRNAs miR-103 and miR-107
are significantly upregulated by lethal doses of stress, resulting in suppression
of LRP1 translation and cell death. Our results define a negative feedback loop
involving the p53-regulated coding gene LRP1 and p53-regulated miRNA genes. These
findings provide mechanistic insight into the selective expression of p53 target 
genes in response to different stress intensities to elicit either cell survival 
or cell death.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) detects estrogen receptor alpha gene (ESR1) fusion
transcripts in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, but their role in 
disease pathogenesis remains unclear. We examined multiple ESR1 fusions and found
that two, both identified in advanced endocrine treatment-resistant disease,
encoded stable and functional fusion proteins. In both examples, ESR1-e6>YAP1 and
ESR1-e6>PCDH11X, ESR1 exons 1-6 were fused in frame to C-terminal sequences from 
the partner gene. Functional properties include estrogen-independent growth,
constitutive expression of ER target genes, and anti-estrogen resistance. Both
fusions activate a metastasis-associated transcriptional program, induce cellular
motility, and promote the development of lung metastasis. ESR1-e6>YAP1- and
ESR1-e6>PCDH11X-induced growth remained sensitive to a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and a
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) naturally expressing the ESR1-e6>YAP1 fusion was 
also responsive. Transcriptionally active ESR1 fusions therefore trigger both
endocrine therapy resistance and metastatic progression, explaining the
association with fatal disease progression, although CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment
is predicted to be effective.

The phase 4 ABOUND.70+ trial assessed the safety and efficacy of
nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin continuously or with a 1-week break between cycles in 
elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients
≥70 years with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to
first-line nab-paclitaxel days 1, 8, 15 plus carboplatin day 1 of a 21-day cycle 
(21d) or the same nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin regimen with a 1-week break between 
cycles (21d + break; 28d). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients
with grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy (PN) or grade ≥ 3 myelosuppression. Other
key endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
and overall response rate (ORR). A total of 143 patients were randomized (71 to
21d, 72 to 21d + break). The percentage of patients with grade ≥ 2 PN or
grade ≥ 3 myelosuppression was similar between the 21d and 21d + break arms (76.5
and 77.1%; P = 0.9258). Treatment exposure was lower in the 21d arm compared with
the 21d + break arm. Median OS was 15.2 and 16.2 months [hazard ratio (HR) 0.72, 
95% CI 0.44-1.19; P = 0.1966], median PFS was 3.6 and 7.0 months (HR 0.48, 95% CI
0.30-0.76; P < 0.0019), and ORR was 23.9 and 40.3% (risk ratio 1.68, 95% CI
1.02-2.78; P = 0.0376) in the 21d and 21d + break arms, respectively. In summary,
the 1-week break between treatment cycles significantly improved PFS and ORR but 
did not significantly reduce the percentage of grade ≥ 2 PN or grade ≥ 3
myelosuppression. Overall, the findings support the results of prior subset
analyses on the safety and efficacy of first-line nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin in
elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.

Heparan Sulfate (HS) is a cell signaling molecule linked to pathological
processes ranging from cancer to viral entry, yet fundamental aspects of its
biosynthesis remain incompletely understood. Here, the binding preferences of the
uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) are examined with variably-sulfated
hexasaccharides. Surprisingly, heavily sulfated oligosaccharides formed by
later-acting sulfotransferases bind more tightly to HS2ST than those
corresponding to its natural substrate or product. Inhibition assays also
indicate that the IC50 values correlate simply with degree of oligosaccharide
sulfation. Structural analysis predicts a mode of inhibition in which 6-O-sulfate
groups located on glucosamine residues present in highly-sulfated
oligosaccharides occupy the canonical binding site of the nucleotide cofactor.
The unexpected finding that oligosaccharides associated with later stages in HS
biosynthesis inhibit HS2ST indicates that the enzyme must be separated temporally
and/or spatially from downstream products during biosynthesis in vivo, and
highlights a challenge for the enzymatic synthesis of lengthy HS chains in vitro.

Tumor antigen heterogeneity limits success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
T-cell therapies. Embryonal carcinomas (EC) and mixed testicular germ cell tumors
(TGCT) containing EC, which are the most aggressive TGCT subtypes, are useful for
dissecting this issue as ECs express the CD30 antigen but also contain CD30-/dim 
cells. We found that CD30-redirected CAR T cells (CD30.CAR T cells) exhibit
antitumor activity in vitro against the human EC cell lines Tera-1, Tera-2, and
NCCIT and putative EC stem cells identified by Hoechst dye staining. Cytolytic
activity of CD30.CAR T cells was complemented by their sustained proliferation
and proinflammatory cytokine production. CD30.CAR T cells also demonstrated
antitumor activity in an in vivo xenograft NOD/SCID/γcnull (NSG) mouse model of
metastatic EC. We observed that CD30.CAR T cells, while targeting CD30+ EC tumor 
cells through the CAR (i.e., antigen-dependent targeting), also eliminated
surrounding CD30- EC cells in an antigen-independent manner, via a cell-cell
contact-dependent Fas/FasL interaction. In addition, ectopic Fas (CD95)
expression in CD30+ Fas- EC was sufficient to improve CD30.CAR T-cell antitumor
activity. Overall, these data suggest that CD30.CAR T cells might be useful as an
immunotherapy for ECs. Additionally, Fas/FasL interaction between tumor cells and
CAR T cells can be exploited to reduce tumor escape due to heterogeneous antigen 
expression or to improve CAR T-cell antitumor activity. Cancer Immunol Res;

BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for patients with
hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings.
Their use in clinical practice has been challenged by significant
inter-individual variability in response and tolerability. Hence, the purpose of 
this paper is to provide a succinct review of the literature on the genetic
factors contributing to this variability.
DESIGN: A systematic search in PUBMED was conducted to identify studies that
investigated the association between germline polymorphisms and disposition,
clinical response and toxicities of aromatase inhibitors, as well as those
evaluating the implications of mutations in ESR1 on clinical response.
RESULTS: Polymorphisms in genes coding for phase I and phase II enzymes
(pharmacokinetic genes) significantly modulated exposure to aromatase inhibitors;
however, there is a paucity of data linking interindividual variability in drug
exposure to clinical response. Furthermore, pharmacogenetic studies interrogating
relationship between polymorphisms in CYP19A1 (the target site of aromatase
inhibitors, i.e. a pharmacodynamic gene) and response yielded conflicting
results. Acquired mutations in ESR1 receptors have been identified as the
underlying mechanism of resistance to aromatase inhibitors, and likely predict
drug response. Although some pharmacogenetic studies have implicated
polymorphisms in CYP19A1 and ESR1 with drug-related side effects, the putative
role of these genes in predicting toxicity warrants further validation.
CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes
appear to influence aromatase inhibitor disposition, response and/or toxicity;
however, prospective interventional studies are needed to understand the
application of genomics to personalize aromatase inhibitor therapy in breast
cancer patients.

Hill (Dr Hirschey); and Schools of Nursing, Duke University, Durham (Drs Pan,
Hockenberry, Shaw, and Lipkus) and Medicine (Dr Kimmick), North Carolina.

BACKGROUND: Exercise outcome expectations (OEs) (ie, what one expects to obtain
or avoid by exercising) are influential to increase exercise among cancer
survivors.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the accessibility (ie, frequency 
one thinks about exercise resulting in an outcome) and importance (ie, one's
value of the outcome) of OEs among breast cancer survivors.
METHODS: Stage IA to IIB breast cancer survivors who were 1 to 5 years
posttreatment completed OE questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to
examine OE accessibility and importance.
RESULTS: The sample (n = 73) was 91.8% white, 5.4% African American, 1.4% Asian
or Pacific Islander, and 1.4% other. The mean age was 58 (SD, 9.6) years. Outcome
expectation importance mean was 6.1 (SD, 0.4), indicating OEs are overall
"important." Accessibility mean was 4.8 (SD, 0.6), demonstrating breast cancer
survivors think about exercise OEs "sometimes/50% of the time." There was a
moderate (rs = 0.48) relationship between OE importance and accessibility,
indicating they are related, yet distinct.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcome expectations are generally important to breast cancer
survivors. Thus, OEs may motivate increased exercise among this population.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology providers should encourage patients to think 
about OEs more often to increase exercise. Compared with traditional approaches
of informing patients about exercise benefits, this may be a more comprehensive
and powerful approach to motivate exercise among breast cancer survivors.

Purpose Cancer surveillance provides a critical evidence base to guide cancer
control efforts, yet population-based coverage in Africa is sparse.
Hospital-based registries may help fill this need by providing local
epidemiologic data to guide policy and forecast local health care needs. We
report the epidemiology of patients with cancer recorded by a de novo
hospital-based cancer registry at Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi, the sole
provider of comprehensive oncology services for half the country and location of 
a high-volume pathology laboratory. Methods We conducted active case finding
across all hospital departments and the pathology laboratory from June 2014 to
March 2016. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and HIV
status were collected. We describe epidemiology of the cancer caseload, registry 
design, and costs associated with registry operations. Results Among 1,446
registered patients, Kaposi sarcoma and cervical cancer were the most common
cancers among men and women, respectively. Burkitt lymphoma was most common
cancer among children. The current rate of pathology confirmation is 65%, a vast 
improvement in the diagnostic capacity for cancer through the hospital's
pathology laboratory. Among leading cancer types, an alarming proportion occurred
at young ages; 50% of Kaposi sarcoma and 25% of esophageal, breast, and cervical 
cancers were diagnosed among those younger than 40 years of age. A systematic,
cross-sectional assessment of HIV status reveals a prevalence of 58% among adults
and 18% among children. Conclusion We report a high caseload among typically
young patients and a significant burden of HIV infection among patients with
cancer. In low- and middle-income countries with intermittent, sparse, or
nonexistent cancer surveillance, hospital-based cancer registries can provide
important local epidemiologic data while efforts to expand population-based
registration continue.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the USA. In 2017, an
estimated 135,420 people were diagnosed with CRC and 50,260 people died from CRC.
Several screening modalities are recommended by the United States Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF), including annual stool tests that are usually
completed at home and under-used compared with colonoscopy despite stated patient
preferences for an alternative to colonoscopy. The Community Preventive Services 
Task Force recommends use of small media interventions (SMIs) to increase CRC
screening and calls for a greater understanding of its independent impact on
screening participation. This study tested whether a SMI increased the likelihood
of participant return of a USPSTF recommended Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT). In
total, 804 individuals participated in a two-group, prospective randomized
controlled trial. Descriptive statistics with chi-square tests compared
differences in participant characteristics and return rates. Multivariable
log-binomial modeling estimated combined effects of patient characteristics with 
FIT return rates. No differences in return rates were observed overall or by
participant characteristics other than the year of enrollment. A multivariable
model controlling for all covariates, found gender, insurance type, and regular
place for healthcare to be significantly associated with return rates. Receipt of
the SMI did not independently increase overall return rates but it may have
improved the ease of completing the FIT by some participants, particularly women,
those with insurance, and those with a regular place for healthcare.

Structural equation modeling is commonly used to capture complex structures of
relationships among multiple variables, both latent and observed. We propose a
general class of structural equation models with a semiparametric component for
potentially censored survival times. We consider nonparametric maximum likelihood
estimation and devise a combined Expectation-Maximization and Newton-Raphson
algorithm for its implementation. We establish conditions for model
identifiability and prove the consistency, asymptotic normality, and
semiparametric efficiency of the estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the
satisfactory performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and
provide an application to a motivating cancer study that contains a variety of
genomic variables. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

BACKGROUND: Treatments for localized prostate cancer present challenging
tradeoffs in the face of uncertain treatment benefits. These options are best
weighed in a process of shared decision-making with the patient's healthcare
team. Minority men experience disparities in prostate cancer outcomes, possibly
due in part to a lack of optimal communication during treatment selection.
Decision aids facilitate shared decision-making, improve knowledge of treatment
options, may increase satisfaction with treatment choice, and likely facilitate
long-term quality of life.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study will compare the effect of two evidence-based decision
aids on patient knowledge and on quality of life measured one year after
treatment, oversampling minority men. One decision aid will be administered prior
to specialist consultation, preparing patients for a treatment discussion. The
other decision aid will be administered within the consultation to facilitate
transparent, preference-sensitive, and evidence-informed deliberations. The study
will utilize a four-arm, block-randomized design to test whether each decision
aid alone (Arms 1 and 2) or in combination (Arm 3) can improve patient knowledge 
and quality of life compared to usual care (Arm 4). The study, funded by the
National Cancer Institute's Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), will be 
deployed within select institutions that have demonstrated capacity to recruit
minority populations into urologic oncology trials.
DISCUSSION: Upon completion of the trial, we will have 1) tested the
effectiveness of two evidence-based decision aids in enhancing patients'
knowledge of options for prostate cancer therapy and 2) estimated whether
decision aids may improve patient quality of life one year after initial
treatment choice.

The directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a powerful tool to model the interactions of 
high-dimensional variables. While estimating edge directions in a DAG often
requires interventional data, one can estimate the skeleton of a DAG (i.e., an
undirected graph formed by removing the direction of each edge in a DAG) using
observational data. In real data analyses, the samples of the high-dimensional
variables may be collected from a mixture of multiple populations. Each
population has its own DAG while the DAGs across populations may have significant
overlap. In this article, we propose a two-step approach to jointly estimate the 
DAG skeletons of multiple populations while the population origin of each sample 
may or may not be labeled. In particular, our method allows a probabilistic soft 
label for each sample, which can be easily computed and often leads to more
accurate skeleton estimation than hard labels. Compared with separate estimation 
of skeletons for each population, our method is more accurate and robust to
labeling errors. We study the estimation consistency for our method, and
demonstrate its performance using simulation studies in different settings.
Finally, we apply our method to analyze gene expression data from breast cancer
patients of multiple cancer subtypes.

Drug resistance remains a formidable challenge to cancer therapy. P-glycoprotein 
(Pgp) contributes to multidrug resistance in numerous cancers by preventing
accumulation of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. Strategies to overcome this
resistance have been vigorously sought for over 3 decades, yet clinical solutions
do not exist. The main reason for the failure is lack of cancer specificity of
small-molecule Pgp inhibitors, thus causing severe toxicity in normal tissues. In
this study, Pgp-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed to achieve
superior cancer specificity through antibody targeting plus locoregional light
activation. Thus, a Pgp monoclonal antibody was chemically modified with IR700, a
porphyrin photosensitizer. In vitro studies showed that the
antibody-photosensitizer conjugates specifically bind to Pgp-expressing drug
resistant cancer cells, and caused dramatic cytotoxicity upon irradiation with a 
near infrared light. We then tested our Pgp-targeted approach in mouse xenograft 
models of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In both models,
targeted PDT produced rapid tumor shrinkage, and significantly prolonged survival
of tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that our targeted PDT approach produces
molecularly targeted and spatially selective ablation of chemoresistant tumors,
and thereby provides an effective approach to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrug
resistance in cancer, where conventional approaches have failed.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence after the 
treatment of patients with rectal cancer with open (OPEN) or laparoscopic (LAP)
resection.
BACKGROUND: This randomized clinical trial (ACOSOG [Alliance] Z6051), performed
between 2008 and 2013, compared LAP and OPEN resection of stage II/III rectal
cancer, within 12 cm of the anal verge (T1-3, N0-2, M0) in patients who received 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The rectum and mesorectum were resected using open
instruments for rectal dissection (included hybrid hand-assisted laparoscopic) or
with laparoscopic instruments under pneumoperitoneum. The 2-year DFS and
recurrence were secondary endpoints of Z6051.
METHODS: The DFS and recurrence were not powered, and are being assessed for
superiority. Recurrence was determined at 3, 6, 9, 12, and every 6 months
thereafter, using carcinoembryonic antigen, physical examination, computed
tomography, and colonoscopy. In all, 486 patients were randomized to LAP (243) or
OPEN (243), with 462 eligible for analysis (LAP = 240 and OPEN = 222). Median
follow-up is 47.9 months.
RESULTS: The 2-year DFS was LAP 79.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.4-84.9)
and OPEN 83.2% (95% CI 78.3-88.3). Local and regional recurrence was 4.6% LAP and
4.5% OPEN. Distant recurrence was 14.6% LAP and 16.7% OPEN.Disease-free survival 
was impacted by unsuccessful resection (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% CI
1.21-2.91): composite of incomplete specimen (HR 1.65, 95% CI 0.85-3.18);
positive circumferential resection margins (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.40-3.79); positive 
distal margin (HR 2.53, 95% CI 1.30-3.77).
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic assisted resection of rectal cancer was not found to be 
significantly different to OPEN resection of rectal cancer based on the outcomes 
of DFS and recurrence.

A hallmark of advanced tumors is a switch to aerobic glycolysis that is readily
measured by [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography
(18F-FDG PET) imaging. Co-mutations in the KRAS proto-oncogene and the LKB1 tumor
suppressor gene are frequent events in lung cancer that drive hypermetabolic,
glycolytic tumor growth. A critical pathway regulating the growth and metabolism 
of these tumors is the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which 
can be effectively targeted using selective catalytic mTOR kinase inhibitors. The
mTOR inhibitor MLN0128 suppresses glycolysis in mice bearing tumors with Kras and
Lkb1 co-mutations, referred to as KL mice. The therapy response in KL mice is
first measured by 18F-FDG PET and computed tomography (CT) imaging before and
after the delivery of MLN0128. By utilizing 18F-FDG PET/CT, researchers are able 
to measure dynamic changes in the glucose metabolism in genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMMs) of lung cancer following a therapeutic intervention with
targeted therapies. This is followed by ex vivo autoradiography and a
quantitative immunohistochemical (qIHC) analysis using morphometric software. The
use of qIHC enables the detection and quantification of distinct changes in the
biomarker profiles following treatment as well as the characterization of
distinct tumor pathologies. The coupling of PET imaging to quantitative histology
is an effective strategy to identify metabolic and therapeutic responses in vivo 
in mouse models of disease.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death. Soluble receptor
for glycation end products (sRAGE), which is modulated by anti-hypertensive (HT) 
medications, has been inversely associated with pancreatic cancer. However, the
association between commonly used anti-HT medications and risk of pancreatic
cancer is unknown. A total of 145,551 postmenopausal women from the Women Health 
Initiative (WHI) Study were included in analysis. Use of angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), β-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and
diuretics was ascertained at baseline (1993⁻1998). Baseline sRAGE levels were
measured among a subset of 2104 participants using an immunoassay. Multivariable 
Cox proportional hazard regression model was performed to estimate hazard ratios 
(HRs) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer in association
with anti-HT medications. Increased risk of pancreatic cancer was found among
users of short-acting CCB (HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.20⁻2.28) and long-term (≥3 years)
users of short-acting CCB (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.42⁻3.02) compared to users of
other anti-HT medications. Average sRAGE levels were lower in short-acting CCB
users than users of other anti-HT medications (1173 versus 1454 pg/mL, p =
0.038). Non-statistically significant reduced risk of pancreatic cancer was found
among users of β-blockers (HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.60⁻1.07). Average sRAGE levels
were higher in β-blockers users than users of other anti-HT medications (1692
versus 1454 pg/mL, p > 0.05). Future studies are warranted to confirm these
findings and elucidate potential mechanisms by which anti-HT medications
influence development of pancreatic cancer.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to test theoretical intervention
fidelity and feasibility of MOVING ON, a self-directed, home-based, randomized
controlled trial to increase exercise outcome expectations (OEs) (what one
expects to obtain or avoid as a result of a behavior or lack thereof), among
breast cancer survivors.
METHOD: Stage Ia to IIb survivors (n = 60) were given the MOVING ON intervention 
or control booklet. Data were collected through online surveys and an
accelerometer at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postintervention. Fidelity was
measured by questions assessing participant perceptions of MOVING ON (score ≥2)
and direction of intervention effects. Feasibility was measured by recruitment
rate (target of 60 participants in 6 months), retention (total attrition <17%),
and acquisition of accelerometer data (% ≥subjective exercise data obtained).
Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, mixed models, and content analysis.
RESULTS: Fidelity met a priori criteria (mean = 3.31, SD = 0.87). Outcome
expectations increased 0.01 points, and weekly steps increased by 970 every
4 weeks in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. All effect sizes
were small, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09. Target enrollment, achieved in 17 weeks,
met a priori feasibility criteria. Retention (66%) and accelerometer data
acquisition (60%) (compared to 73% of subjective exercise data) did not.
CONCLUSION: MOVING ON influenced OEs as intended and was well received by
participants. A fully powered study, of this low-cost, easy-to-implement
intervention, is warranted. Intervention and measurement strategies used in
MOVING ON can be incorporated in any study targeting OEs as a mediator of
exercise or collecting exercise data with an accelerometer.

Prior studies of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) have
explored the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) as an independent risk factor; 
however, none have investigated the interaction of known risk factors with SES.
We examined this using the North Carolina Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology
Study, a population-based case-control study. Incident cases of SCCHN from North 
Carolina between 2002 and 2006 (n = 1,153) were identified and age, sex, and
race-matched controls (n = 1,267) were selected from driver license records. SES 
measures included household income, educational attainment, and health insurance.
Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Current smoking was more strongly associated with
SCCHN among those households making < $20,000/year [OR 5.11 (3.61-6.61)] compared
to household incomes > $50,000/year [OR 2.47 (1.69-3.25); p interaction < 0.001].
Current drinking was more strongly associated with SCCHN in household incomes
< $20,000 [OR 2.91 (2.05-3.78)] compared to > $50,000/year [1.28 (0.97-1.58); p
interaction < 0.001]. Current drinkers with less than high school education or
income < $20,000 had nearly threefold odds of never-drinkers in the same SES
category [OR 2.91 (2.05-3.78); 2.09 (1.39-2.78), respectively]. Our results
suggest that the relationship of smoking and alcohol use may be stronger among
those of lower SES.

Membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), a membrane-tethered protease,
is key for matrix breakdown during cancer invasion and metastasis. Assembly of
branched actin networks by the Arp2/3 complex is required for MT1-MMP traffic and
formation of matrix-degradative invadopodia. Contrasting with the
well-established role of actin filament branching factor cortactin in invadopodia
function during cancer cell invasion, the contribution of coronin-family
debranching factors to invadopodia-based matrix remodeling is not known. Here, we
investigated the contribution of coronin 1C to the invasive potential of breast
cancer cells. We report that expression of coronin 1C is elevated in invasive
human breast cancers, correlates positively with MT1-MMP expression in relation
with increased metastatic risk and is a new independent prognostic factor in
breast cancer. We provide evidence that, akin to cortactin, coronin 1C is
required for invadopodia formation and matrix degradation by breast cancer cells 
lines and for 3D collagen invasion by multicellular spheroids. Using intravital
imaging of orthotopic human breast tumor xenografts, we find that coronin 1C
accumulates in structures forming in association with collagen fibrils in the
tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we establish the role of coronin 1C in the
regulation of positioning and trafficking of MT1-MMP-positive endolysosomes.
These results identify coronin 1C as a novel player of the multi-faceted
mechanism responsible for invadopodia formation, MT1-MMP surface exposure and
invasiveness in breast cancer cells.

BCG has been used as intravesical immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder
carcinoma. However, this treatment is not harmless and may lead to complications,
with a reported incidence of systemic BCG infection ranging from 3% to 7%. We
report a case of culture-proven Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) vertebral osteomyelitis
in a 72-year-old patient with bladder carcinoma who was treated with intravesical
mitomycin C but did not receive BCG. Cultures from biopsy recovered isolate
resembling Mycobacterium tuberculosis biochemically, but resistant to
pyrazinamide (PZA). The patient was originally started on a four-drug
antituberculous regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and PZA. After
genotypic analysis identified the organism as M. bovis (BCG), the regimen was
changed to isoniazid and rifampin for 12 months. The patient responded well to
this treatment. This case is unique as the patient received only intravesical
mitomycin and did not receive BCG, implying the possibility of transmission from 
contaminated equipment.

The ability of cells to adapt their response to growth factors in relation to
their environment is an essential aspect of tissue development and homeostasis.
We found that signaling mediated by the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases
from cell-cell contacts changed the cellular response to the growth factor EGF by
modulating the vesicular trafficking of its receptor, EGFR. Eph receptor
activation trapped EGFR in Rab5-positive early endosomes by inhibiting
Akt-dependent vesicular recycling. By altering the spatial distribution of EGFR
activity, EGF-promoted Akt signaling from the plasma membrane was suppressed,
thereby inhibiting cell migration. In contrast, ERK signaling from endosomal EGFR
was preserved to maintain a proliferative response to EGF stimulation. We also
found that soluble extracellular signals engaging the G protein-coupled receptor 
Kiss1 (Kiss1R) similarly suppressed EGFR vesicular recycling to inhibit
EGF-promoted migration. Eph or Kiss1R activation also suppressed EGF-promoted
migration in Pten-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which exhibit increased
constitutive Akt activity, and in MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells,
which overexpress EGFR. The cellular environment can thus generate
context-dependent responses to EGF stimulation by modulating EGFR vesicular
trafficking dynamics.

BACKGROUND: A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietary 
patterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neck
cancer risk when multiple populations are available.
METHODS: We used individual-level pooled data from seven case-control studies
(3,844 cases; 6,824 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck
Cancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared and
study-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-study
factor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined,
and larynx, from logistic regression models.
RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible across
studies (75% variance explained): the Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber (OR=0.57,
CI: 0.41-0.78, highest vs. lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR=0.80, CI:
0.67-0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer
risk. The Animal products and cereals (OR=1.5, CI: 1.1-2.1) and the Fats (OR=1.8,
CI: 1.4-2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk,
whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for the
Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additional
study-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We named
them all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals and two were associated with
oral and pharyngeal cancer risk.
CONCLUSION: Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into pattern
reproducibility, and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibility 
of dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk.

OBJECTIVE: The relevance of margin positivity on recurrence after resection of
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) is poorly defined and represents
one reason controversy remains regarding optimal surveillance recommendations.
METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery for noninvasive IPMN at 8 academic medical
centers from the Central Pancreas Consortium were analyzed. A positive margin was
defined as presence of IPMN or pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia.
RESULTS: Five hundred two patients underwent surgery for IPMN; 330 (66%) did not 
have invasive cancer on final pathology and form the study cohort. Of these, 20% 
harbored high grade dysplasia. A positive margin was found in 20% of cases and
was associated with multifocal disease (P = 0.02). The majority of positive
margins were associated with low grade dysplasia. At a median follow-up of 36
months, 34 (10.3%) patients recurred, with 6.7% developing recurrent cystic
disease and 3.6% developing invasive cancer. On multivariate analysis, margin
positivity was not associated with recurrence of either IPMN or invasive cancer
(P > 0.05). No association between margin status and development of recurrence at
the margin was found. Only 6% of recurrences developed at the resection margin
and median time to recurrence was 22 months. Of note, 18% of recurrences occurred
> 5 years following surgery.
CONCLUSION: Margin positivity after resection for noninvasive IPMNs is primarily 
due to low grade dysplasia and is not associated with developing recurrence in
the remnant pancreas or at the resection margin. Long-term surveillance is
required for all patients, as a significant number of recurrences developed over 
5 years after the index operation.

Radical surgery still represents the treatment choice for several malignancies.
However, local and distant tumor relapses remain the major causes of treatment
failure, indicating that a postsurgery consolidation treatment is necessary.
Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has elicited impressive clinical
responses in several types of human malignancies and may represent the ideal
consolidation treatment after surgery. Here, we genetically engineered platelets 
from megakaryocyte (MK) progenitor cells to express the programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1). The PD-1 platelet and its derived microparticle could
accumulate within the tumor surgical wound and revert exhausted CD8+ T cells,
leading to the eradication of residual tumor cells. Furthermore, when a low dose 
of cyclophosphamide (CP) was loaded into PD-1-expressing platelets to
deplete regulatory T cells (Tregs), an increased frequency of reinvigorated CD8+ 
lymphocyte cells was observed within the postsurgery tumor microenvironment,
directly preventing tumor relapse.

Microbial β-glucuronidases (GUSs) cause severe gut toxicities that limit the
efficacy of cancer drugs and other therapeutics. Selective inhibitors of
bacterial GUS have been shown to alleviate these side effects. Using structural
and chemical biology, mass spectrometry, and cell-based assays, we establish that
piperazine-containing GUS inhibitors intercept the glycosyl-enzyme catalytic
intermediate of these retaining glycosyl hydrolases. We demonstrate that
piperazine-based compounds are substrate-dependent GUS inhibitors that bind to
the GUS-GlcA catalytic intermediate as a piperazine-linked glucuronide (GlcA,
glucuronic acid). We confirm the GUS-dependent formation of inhibitor-glucuronide
conjugates by LC-MS and show that methylated piperazine analogs display
significantly reduced potencies. We further demonstrate that a range of approved 
piperazine- and piperidine-containing drugs from many classes, including those
for the treatment of depression, infection, and cancer, function by the same
mechanism, and we confirm through gene editing that these compounds selectively
inhibit GUS in living bacterial cells. Together, these data reveal a unique
mechanism of GUS inhibition and show that a range of therapeutics may impact GUS 
activities in the human gut.

Therapeutic agents used in the treatment of cancer are known to develop
resistance against cancer cells. Hence, there is a continuing need to investigate
novel agents for the treatment and management of cancer. Antitumor activity of
greensporone C (GC), a new resorcylic acid lactone isolated from an organic
extract of a culture of a Halenospora sp. freshwater fungus, was subjected for
screening against a panel of leukemic cell lines (K562, U937, and AR320). In all 
the three cell lines, cell proliferation was inhibited in dose-dependent fashion.
GC further arrested the cells in SubG0 phase in dose-dependent manner. Annexin
V/PI dual staining data confirmed apoptotic death of treated K562 and U937
leukemic cells. Treatment with GC suppressed constitutively phosphorylated AKT
and downregulated expression of inhibitor of apoptotic proteins XIAP, cIAP-1, and
cIAP-2. In summation to this, GC-treated leukemic cells upregulated protein
expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax with concomitant decrease in expression
of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Upregulation of Bax was
associated with cytochrome c release which was confirmed from the collapse of
mitochondrial membrane. Released cytochrome c further activated caspase cascade
which in turn initiated apoptosis process. Anticancer activity of this isolated
fungal compound GC was potentiated via stimulating production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) along with depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in K562
and U937 leukemic cells. Pretreatment of these cells with N-acetyl cysteine
prevented GC-induced depletion of reduced GSH level and
mitochondrial-caspase-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data show that GC
modulates the apoptotic response of human leukemic cells and raises the
possibility of its use as a novel therapeutic strategy for hematological
malignancies.

Purpose: Prognostic value of pathologic complete response (pCR) and extent of
pathologic response attained with anthracycline-free platinum plus taxane
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is
unknown. We report recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)
according to degree of pathologic response in patients treated with carboplatin
plus docetaxel NAC.Experimental Design: One-hundred and ninety patients with
stage I-III TNBC were treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin (AUC6) plus docetaxel 
(75 mg/m2) every 21 days × 6 cycles. pCR (no evidence of invasive tumor in breast
and axilla) and Residual cancer burden (RCB) were evaluated. Patients were
followed for recurrence and survival. Extent of pathologic response was
associated with RFS and OS using the Kaplan-Meier method.Results: Median age was 
51 years, and 52% were node-positive. pCR and RCB I rates were 55% and 13%,
respectively. Five percent of pCR patients, 0% of RCB I patients, and 58% of RCB 
II/III patients received adjuvant anthracyclines. Three-year RFS and OS were 79% 
and 87%, respectively. Three-year RFS was 90% in patients with pCR and 66% in
those without pCR [HR = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.62; P =
0.0001]. Three-year OS was 94% in patients with pCR and 79% in those without pCR 
(HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10-0.63; P = 0.001). Patients with RCB I demonstrated
3-year RFS (93%) and OS (100%) similar to those with pCR. On multivariable
analysis, higher tumor stage, node positivity, and RCB II/III were associated
with worse RFS.Conclusions: Neoadjuvant carboplatin plus docetaxel yields
encouraging efficacy in TNBC. Patients achieving pCR or RCB I with this regimen
demonstrate excellent 3-year RFS and OS without adjuvant anthracycline. Clin

BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial 
demonstrated equivalent survival in early-stage breast cancer (BC) patients
receiving either axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node
dissection (SLND) alone. However, institutional studies have called into question
the generalization of these findings outside of a clinical trial.
METHODS: Early-stage BC patients diagnosed in 2013, that received lumpectomy with
whole-breast irradiation, and underwent either ALND or SLND alone, in National
Cancer Database were included. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate
45-month survival, accounting for demographics, comorbidities, insurance type,
cancer and neighborhood characteristics.
RESULTS: 62,184 patients were included, of which 21,892 (35%) underwent ALND.
Patients undergoing ALND, compared to SLND, appeared to have slightly lower
survival (91.4% vs 95.1%); moreover, even after weighting, a small difference
persisted (92.7% vs 94.7%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97, 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: SLND is a safe and effective alternative to ALND in BC patients with
limited nodal involvement. This study provides additional evidence that the
findings of ACOSOG Z0011 are applicable to the larger early-stage BC population.

Background: Evidence from observational studies of telomere length (TL) has been 
conflicting regarding its direction of association with cancer risk. We
investigated the causal relevance of TL for lung and head and neck cancers using 
Mendelian Randomization (MR) and mediation analyses.
Methods: We developed a novel genetic instrument for TL in chromosome 5p15.33,
using variants identified through deep-sequencing, that were genotyped in 2051
cancer-free subjects. Next, we conducted an MR analysis of lung (16 396 cases,
13 013 controls) and head and neck cancer (4415 cases, 5013 controls) using eight
genetic instruments for TL. Lastly, the 5p15.33 instrument and distinct 5p15.33
lung cancer risk loci were evaluated using two-sample mediation analysis, to
quantify their direct and indirect, telomere-mediated, effects.
Results: The multi-allelic 5p15.33 instrument explained 1.49-2.00% of TL
variation in our data (p = 2.6 × 10-9). The MR analysis estimated that a 1000
base-pair increase in TL increases risk of lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.41,
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.65] and lung adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.92, 95% 
CI: 1.51-2.22), but not squamous lung carcinoma (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.83-1.29) or
head and neck cancers (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.70-1.05). Mediation analysis of the
5p15.33 instrument indicated an absence of direct effects on lung cancer risk
(OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.95-1.04). Analysis of distinct 5p15.33 susceptibility
variants estimated that TL mediates up to 40% of the observed associations with
lung cancer risk.
Conclusions: Our findings support a causal role for long telomeres in lung cancer
aetiology, particularly for adenocarcinoma, and demonstrate that telomere
maintenance partially mediates the lung cancer susceptibility conferred by
5p15.33 loci.

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer, carries 
a life expectancy of 12-15 months. The short life expectancy is due in part to
the inability of the current treatment, consisting of surgical resection followed
by radiation and chemotherapy, to eliminate invasive tumor foci. Treatment of
these foci may be improved with tumoricidal human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). 
MSCs exhibit potent tumor tropism and can be engineered to express therapeutic
proteins that kill tumor cells. Advancements in preclinical models indicate that 
surgical resection induces premature MSC loss and reduces therapeutic efficacy.
Efficacy of MSC treatment can be improved by seeding MSCs on a biodegradable
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) scaffold. MSC delivery into the surgical resection cavity
on a PLA scaffold restores cell retention, persistence, and tumor killing. To
study the effects of MSC-seeded PLA implantation on GBM, an accurate preclinical 
model is needed. Here we provide a preclinical surgical protocol for image-guided
tumor resection of GBM in immune-deficient mice followed by MSC-seeded scaffold
implantation. MSCs are engineered with lentiviral constructs to constitutively
express and secrete therapeutic TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) as
well as green fluorescent protein (GFP) to allow fluorescent tracking. Similarly,
the U87 tumor cells are engineered to express mCherry and firefly luciferase,
providing dual fluorescent/luminescent tracking. While currently used for
investigating stem cell mediated delivery of therapeutics, this protocol could be
modified to investigate the impact of surgical resection on other GBM
interventions.

A systematic scoping review of the recent literature (∼2011-2017) about the costs
of illness to parents of children diagnosed with cancer.

PURPOSE: The study purpose was to map and identify gaps in the recent
(∼2011-2017) literature on the costs of illness to parents of children diagnosed 
with cancer. The costs of illness include direct costs, indirect costs and
psychosocial costs.
METHODS: A systematic scoping review was conducted. Data sources included PubMed,
CINAHL, PsychInfo and EconLit. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were
conducted in high-income countries, published in the English language, and
reported parent perspectives on direct costs, indirect costs and/or psychosocial 
costs due to financial costs.
RESULTS: 25 studies were eligible. Most were conducted in Canada, the USA, or
Sweden. The studies used a variety of designs, target populations, time frames
and sample sizes. Intervention studies were lacking. Across studies fathers were 
underrepresented. While no study comprehensively measured costs of illness, more 
studies used rigorous methods and considered psychosocial costs. Financial costs 
were measured using a micro-costing or general estimates approach. Psychosocial
costs were measured using a variety of PRO measures, some of which were
investigator developed. The studies provide evidence that financial toxicity
occurs in pediatric oncology.
CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should comprehensively measure costs using a
consistent set of established measures and make efforts to recruit fathers to
cost of illness research. Interventions to mitigate financial toxicity are
needed.

Inequalities between native-born and foreign-born individuals in screening rates 
for a variety of conditions have been well-documented in literature on immigrant 
health. A preponderance of this research focuses on the Latin American case and
on cancer-specific screening. This study seeks to expand knowledge of such
preventative-health screening differences by analyzing screening rates for blood 
sugar, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol among nine groups overall and (for
immigrants) at various stages of US residency. Using nationally representative
data from the National Health Interview Survey, we find that immigrants from
eight geographic regions receive preventative care at lower rates than US-born
Whites and that preventative screening is generally higher after 15 years than
during the first 4 years of residency in the United States. Importantly, our data
also show that screening patterns and trends vary based on region of origin and
outcome. These findings improve our understanding of immigrant health and
health care use in the United States.

PURPOSE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an emerging option for
localized prostate cancer. However, there are no standard dosimetric guidelines, 
and normal tissue tolerances for extreme hypofractionation are not well defined. 
We analyzed dosimetric correlations with patient-reported urinary and bowel
quality of life (QOL) on a prospective trial.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer
from 18 institutions were enrolled on a phase 2 trial from 2007 to 2012 and
treated using robotic SBRT to 38 Gy in 4 fractions on consecutive days. No
androgen deprivation was used. Patients received simulation with Foley catheter
for urethral delineation. The clinical target volume was prostate (low-risk
patients) or prostate plus 1 cm of proximal seminal vesicles (intermediate-risk
patients). Multiple dosimetric measures for urethra, bladder, and rectum were
prospectively recorded. QOL using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite
was assessed before and after treatment at protocol-specific time points. Linear 
regression was used to assess factors associated with QOL at 1 month and 2 years.
RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were enrolled. QOL data were available for 98%, 
96%, and 84% at baseline, 1 month, and 2 years, respectively. Median age was
69 years. Prior transurethral resection of the prostate and clinical target
volume size were associated with 2-year urinary incontinence. There was a trend
toward worse 2-year obstruction/irritation in older patients on multivariable
analysis. Bladder and urethral doses were not associated with either 1-month or
2-year urinary QOL. In contrast, rectum maximum dose was associated with both
1-month and 2-year bowel QOL. At 2 years, the proportion with moderate or big
overall bowel problems (as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer Index
Composite-26) was significantly higher in patients with rectum maximum dose
greater than versus less than the median 37.4 Gy (11% vs 2%, Fisher's exact test 
P = .008).
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide novel data that contribute to a better
understanding of patient and dosimetric factors associated with adverse QOL
effects from prostate SBRT.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a chronic inflammatory condition strongly associated with 
the risk of numerous cancers. We examined the association between circulating
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a biomarker of inflammation and
strong correlate of obesity, and the risk of three understudied obesity-related
cancers in postmenopausal women: ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, and multiple
myeloma.
METHODS: Participants were 24,205 postmenopausal women who had measurements of
baseline serum hsCRP (mg/L) in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) CVD Biomarkers
Cohort, a collection of four sub-studies within the WHI. Incident cancers were
identified over 17.9 years of follow-up (n = 153 ovarian, n = 110 kidney, n = 137
multiple myeloma). hsCRP was categorized into study-specific quartiles. Adjusted 
Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for associations of baseline hsCRP with the risk of these cancers.
RESULTS: There was no clear association between baseline hsCRP concentration and 
the risk of ovarian cancer (quartile 4 vs. 1: HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56-1.37), kidney 
cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.56-1.61), or multiple myeloma (HR 0.82, 95% CI
0.52-1.29). HRs for 1 mg/L increases in hsCRP also approximated the null value
for each cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that elevated CRP is not a major
risk factor for these obesity-related cancers (ovarian or kidney cancers, or
multiple myeloma) among postmenopausal women. Given the importance of elucidating
the mechanisms underlying the association of obesity with cancer risk, further
analysis with expanded biomarkers and in larger or pooled prospective cohorts is 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Although most countries in southern Africa have cervical cancer
screening programs, these programs generally fail to reach a significant majority
of women because they are often implemented as pilot or research projects, and
this limits their scope and ability to scale up screening. Some countries have
planned larger-scale programs, but these have either never been implemented or
have not been successfully scaled up. Most of the global burden of cervical
cancer is experienced in countries with limited resources, and mortality from
cervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women in 
Sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to learn about preferences for cervical
cancer screening in Zambia, to identify barriers and facilitators for screening
uptake, and to evaluate willingness to pay for screening services to support the 
scaling up of cervical cancer screening programs.
METHODS: We will conduct a discrete choice experiment by interviewing women and
men and asking them to choose among constructed scenarios with varying
combinations of attributes relevant to cervical cancer screening. To inform the
discrete choice experiment, we will conduct focus groups and interviews about
general knowledge and attitudes about cervical screening, perception about the
availability of screening, stigma associated with cancer and HIV, and payment for
health care services. For the discrete choice experiment, we will have a maximum 
design of 120 choice sets divided into 15 sets of 8 tasks each with a sample size
of 320-400 respondents. We will use a hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedure 
to assess attributes at the following two levels: group and individual levels.
RESULTS: The model will generate preferences for attributes to assess the most
important features and allow for the assessment of differences among cohorts. We 
will conduct policy simulations reflecting potential changes in the attributes of
the screening facilities and calculate the projected changes in preference for
choosing to undergo cervical cancer screening. The findings from the discrete
choice experiment will be supplemented with interviews, focus groups, and patient
surveys to ensure a comprehensive and context-based interpretation of the
results.
CONCLUSIONS: Because willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening has not
been previously assessed, this will be a unique and important contribution to the
literature. This study will take into account the high HIV prevalence in
Sub-Saharan Africa and prevailing gender attitudes to identify an optimal package
of interventions to reduce cervical cancer incidence. This simulation of women's 
decisions (and men's support) to undergo screening will lay the foundation for
understanding the stated preferences and willingness to pay to help design future
screening programs.

Histone posttranslational modifications control the organization and function of 
chromatin. In particular, methylation of lysine 36 in histone H3 (H3K36me) has
been shown to mediate gene transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and 
pre-mRNA splicing. Notably, mutations at or near this residue have been causally 
linked to the development of several human cancers. These observations have
helped to illuminate the role of histones themselves in disease and to clarify
the mechanisms by which they acquire oncogenic properties. This perspective
focuses on recent advances in discovery and characterization of histone H3
mutations that impact H3K36 methylation. We also highlight findings that the
common cancer-related substitution of H3K36 to methionine (H3K36M) disturbs
functions of not only H3K36me-writing enzymes but also H3K36me-specific readers. 
The latter case suggests that the oncogenic effects could also be linked to the
inability of readers to engage H3K36M.

MEK inhibition is of interest in cancer drug development, but clinical activity
in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been limited. Preclinical studies
demonstrated Wnt pathway overexpression in KRAS-mutant cell lines resistant to
the MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. The combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A,
a noncanonical Wnt pathway modulator, demonstrated antitumor activity in mCRC
patient-derived xenografts. To translate these results, we conducted a NCI Cancer
Therapy Evaluation Program-approved multicenter phase I/IB trial (NCT02188264) of
the combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A. Patients with advanced solid
malignancies were treated with the combination of oral selumetinib and
cyclosporin A in the dose escalation phase, followed by an expansion cohort of
irinotecan and oxaliplatin-refractory mCRC. The expansion cohort utilized a
single-agent selumetinib "run-in" to evaluate FZD2 biomarker upregulation and
KRAS-WT and KRAS-MT stratification to identify any potential predictors of
efficacy. Twenty and 19 patients were enrolled in dose escalation and expansion
phases, respectively. The most common adverse events and grade 3/4 toxicities
were rash, hypertension, and edema. Three dose-limiting toxicities (grade 3
hypertension, rash, and increased creatinine) were reported. The MTD was
selumetinib 75 mg twice daily and cyclosporin A 2 mg/kg twice daily on a 28-day
cycle. KRAS stratification did not identify any differences in response between
KRAS-WT and KRAS-MT cancers. Two partial responses, 18 stable disease, and 10
progressive disease responses were observed. Combination selumetinib and
cyclosporin A is well tolerated, with evidence of activity in mCRC. Future
strategies for concept development include identifying better predictors of
efficacy and improved Wnt pathway modulation.Significance: These findings
translate preclinical studies combining selumetinib and cyclosporin into a phase 
I first-in-human clinical trial of such a combination in patients with advanced
solid malignancies. Cancer Res; 78(18); 5398-407. ©2018 AACR.

Purpose: Response to a complex trastuzumab-based regimen is affected by multiple 
features of the tumor and its microenvironment. Developing a predictive algorithm
is key to optimizing HER2-targeting therapy.Experimental Design: We analyzed 137 
pretreatment tumors with mRNA-seq and DNA exome sequencing from CALGB 40601, a
neoadjuvant phase III trial of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab with or without
lapatinib in stage II to III HER2-positive breast cancer. We adopted an Elastic
Net regularized regression approach that controls for covarying features within
high-dimensional data. First, we applied 517 known gene expression signatures to 
develop an Elastic Net model to predict pCR, which we validated on 143 samples
from four independent trials. Next, we performed integrative analyses
incorporating clinicopathologic information with somatic mutation status, DNA
copy number alterations (CNA), and gene signatures.Results: The Elastic Net model
using only gene signatures predicted pCR in the validation sets (AUC = 0.76).
Integrative analyses showed that models containing gene signatures, clinical
features, and DNA information were better pCR predictors than models containing a
single data type. Frequently selected variables from the multiplatform models
included amplifications of chromosome 6p, TP53 mutation, HER2-enriched subtype,
and immune signatures. Variables predicting resistance included Luminal/ER+
features.Conclusions: Models using RNA only, as well as integrated RNA and DNA
models, can predict pCR with improved accuracy over clinical variables. Somatic
DNA alterations (mutation, CNAs), tumor molecular subtype (HER2E, Luminal), and
the microenvironment (immune cells) were independent predictors of response to
trastuzumab and paclitaxel-based regimens. This highlights the complexity of
predicting response in HER2-positive breast cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 1-13. ©2018

Increasing evidence suggests that extracellular miRNAs may serve as biomarkers of
diseases, but the physiological relevance of extracellular miRNA is unclear. We
find that intradermal cheek injection of miR-711 induces TRPA1-depedent itch
(scratching) without pain (wiping) in naive mice. Extracellular perfusion of
miR-711 induces TRPA1 currents in both Trpa1-expressing heterologous cells and
native sensory neurons through the core sequence GGGACCC. Computer simulations
reveal that the core sequence binds several residues at the extracellular S5-S6
loop of TRPA1, which are critical for TRPA1 activation by miR-711 but not allyl
isothiocyanate. Intradermal inoculation of human Myla cells induces lymphoma and 
chronic itch in immune-deficient mice, associated with increased serum levels of 
miR-711, secreted from cancer cells. Lymphoma-induced chronic itch is suppressed 
by miR-711 inhibitor and a blocking peptide that disrupts the miR-711/TRPA1
interaction. Our findings demonstrated an unconventional physiological role of
extracellular naked miRNAs as itch mediators and ion channel modulators.

Data on psychological distress and its association with clinical outcomes in
patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) are lacking. We used data 
of patients with chronic GVHD (N = 482) from the Chronic GVHD Consortium, a
prospective observational multicenter cohort. We examined the relationship
between self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms (measured by the Lee Symptom
Scale) and patients' quality of life (QOL; measured by the Functional Assessment 
of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G] and the Physical Component Scale [PCS] of the 
36-item Short-Form Health Survey), physical functioning (measured by the Human
Activity Profile), functional status (measured by the 2-minute walk test), and
overall survival (OS). Overall, 19.3% of patients (93/481) reported being
moderately to extremely bothered by depression, and 22.8% (110/482) reported
being moderately to extremely bothered by anxiety, with 14.1% (68/482) of those
reporting being bothered by both. In multivariable models adjusted for clinical
covariates, patients with self-reported depression had worse QOL (FACT-G:
β = -23.09, P < .001; PCS: β = -4.94, P < .001), physical functioning (β = -8.31,
P < .001), functional status (β = -37.21, P = .025), and lower OS (hazard ratio, 
1.62; P = .020) compared with those with no depression symptoms. Patients who
reported anxiety also had lower QOL (FACT-G: β = -19.47, P < .001; PCS:
β = -3.91, P < .001), physical functioning (β = -6.69, P < .001), and functional 
status (β = -32.42, P = .036) but no difference in OS. Patients with chronic GVHD
who report depression or anxiety symptoms have significantly compromised QOL and 
physical functioning. Self-reported depression is associated with lower OS.
Patients with chronic GVHD and self-reported depression or anxiety represent a
highly vulnerable population at risk for poor clinical outcomes and substantial
morbidity from their illness.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ZEBRA protein activates the EBV lytic cycle. Cellular
AP-1 proteins with alanine-to-serine [AP-1(A/S)] substitutions homologous to
ZEBRA(S186) assume some functions of EBV ZEBRA. These AP-1(A/S) mutants bind
methylated EBV DNA and activate expression of some EBV genes. Here, we compare
expression of 67 viral genes induced by ZEBRA versus expression induced by
AP-1(A/S) proteins. AP-1(A/S) activated 24 genes to high levels and 15 genes to
intermediate levels; activation of 28 genes by AP-1(A/S) was severely impaired.
We show that AP-1(A/S) proteins are defective at stimulating viral lytic DNA
replication. The impairment of expression of many late genes compared to that of 
ZEBRA is likely due to the inability of AP-1(A/S) proteins to promote viral DNA
replication. However, even in the absence of detectable viral DNA replication,
AP-1(A/S) proteins stimulated expression of a subgroup of late genes that encode 
viral structural proteins and immune modulators. In response to ZEBRA, expression
of this subgroup of late genes was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), which
is a potent viral replication inhibitor. However, when the lytic cycle was
activated by AP-1(A/S), PAA did not reduce expression of this subgroup of late
genes. We also provide genetic evidence, using the BMRF1 knockout bacmid, that
these genes are true late genes in response to ZEBRA. AP-1(A/S) binds to the
promoter region of at least one of these late genes, BDLF3, encoding an immune
modulator.IMPORTANCE Mutant c-Jun and c-Fos proteins selectively activate
expression of EBV lytic genes, including a subgroup of viral late genes, in the
absence of viral DNA replication. These findings indicate that newly synthesized 
viral DNA is not invariably required for viral late gene expression. While viral 
DNA replication may be obligatory for late gene expression driven by viral
transcription factors, it does not limit the ability of cellular transcription
factors to activate expression of some viral late genes. Our results show that
expression of all late genes may not be strictly dependent on viral lytic DNA
replication. The c-Fos A151S mutation has been identified in a human cancer.
c-Fos A151S in combination with wild-type c-Jun activates the EBV lytic cycle.
Our data provide proof of principle that mutant cellular transcription factors
could cause aberrant regulation of viral lytic cycle gene expression and play
important roles in EBV-associated diseases.

Development and cancer share a variety of functional traits such as EMT, cell
migration, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. In addition, many cellular
signaling pathways are noted to coordinate developmental processes and facilitate
aspects of tumor progression. The Forkhead box superfamily of transcription
factors consists of a highly conserved DNA binding domain, which binds to
specific DNA sequences and play significant roles during adult tissue
homoeostasis and embryogenesis including development, differentiation,
metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Interestingly,
various studies have implicated the role of key Fox family members such as FOXP, 
FOXO, and FOXA during cancer initiation and metastases. FOXI3, a member of the
Forkhead family affects embryogenesis, development, and bone remodeling; however,
no studies have reported a role in cancer. In this review, we summarize the role 
of FOXI3 in embryogenesis and bone development and discuss its potential
involvement in cancer progression with a focus on the bone metastasis. Moreover, 
we hypothesize possible mechanisms underlying the role of FOXI3 in the
development of solid tumor bone metastasis.

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths among women 
worldwide, with an overall 5-year survival of only 30-40%. Carbonic anhydrases
are up-regulated in many types of cancer and play an important role in tumor
progression and metastasis. Carbonic anhydrase 9 has been implicated as a
potential anti-tumorigenic target. Topiramate (TPM) is a potent inhibitor of
carbonic anhydrase isozymes, including carbonic anhydrase 9, and has been shown
to have anti-tumorigenic activity in several cancer types. Our goal was to
evaluate the effect of TPM on cell proliferation and to identify possible
mechanisms by which TPM inhibits cell growth in ovarian cancer. TPM significantly
inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and induced cell cycle G1 arrest,
cellular stress and apoptosis through the AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways. TPM also
exerted anti-metastatic effects by decreasing the adhesion and invasion of
ovarian cancer cells and affecting the expression of critical regulators of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our findings demonstrate that TPM has
anti-tumorigenic effects in ovarian cancer and is worthy of further exploration
in clinical trials.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess adolescent health care providers' recommendations for,
and attitudes towards human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in 5 countries.
DESIGN: In-depth interviews of adolescent health care providers, 2013-2014.
SETTING: Five countries where HPV vaccination is at various stages of
implementation into national programs: Argentina, Malaysia, South Africa, South
Korea, and Spain.
PARTICIPANTS: Adolescent health care providers (N = 151) who had administered or 
overseen provision of adolescent vaccinations (N = Argentina: 30, Malaysia: 30,
South Africa: 31, South Korea: 30, Spain: 30).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of HPV vaccination recommendation, reasons
providers do not always recommend the vaccine and facilitators to doing so,
comfort level with recommending the vaccine, reasons for any discomfort, and
positive and negative aspects of HPV vaccination.
RESULTS: Over half of providers 82/151 (54%) recommend HPV vaccination always or 
most of the time (range: 20% in Malaysia to 90% in Argentina). Most providers
112/151 (74%) said they were comfortable recommending HPV vaccination, although
South Korea was an outlier 10/30 (33%). Providers cited protection against
cervical cancer 124/151 (83%) and genital warts 56/151 (37%) as benefits of HPV
vaccination. When asked about the problems with HPV vaccination, providers
mentioned high cost 75/151 (50% overall; range: 26% in South Africa to 77% in
South Korea) and vaccination safety 28/151 (19%; range: 7% in South Africa to 33%
in Spain). Free, low-cost, or publicly available vaccination 59/151 (39%), and
additional data on vaccination safety 52/151 (34%) and efficacy 43/151 (28%) were
the most commonly cited facilitators of health provider vaccination
recommendation.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to increase HPV vaccination should consider a country's
specific provider concerns, such as reducing cost and providing information on
vaccination safety and efficacy.

In research focused on the discovery of new chemical diversity from freshwater
fungi, a peak library was built and evaluated against a prostate cancer cell
line, E006AA-hT, which was derived from an African American, as this population
is disproportionately affected by prostate cancer. The chemical study of the
bioactive sample accessioned as G858 (Delitschia sp.) led to the isolation of
eight new α-pyrone derivatives (1:  - 7: , and 11: ), as well as the new
3S*,4S*-7-ethyl-4,8-dihydroxy-3,6-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one (15: 
). In addition, the known compounds
5-(3-S-hydroxybutyl)-4-methoxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (8: ),
5-(3-oxobutyl)-4-methoxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (9: ), pyrenocine I (10: ),
5-butyl-6-(hydroxymethyl)-4-methoxy-2H-pyran-2-one (12: ), sporidesmin A (13: ), 
6-ethyl-2,7-dimethoxyjuglone (14: ), artrichitin (16: ), and lipopeptide 15G256ε 
(17: ) were also obtained. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated
using a set of spectroscopic (NMR) and spectrometric (HRMS) methods. The absolute
configuration of the most abundant member of each subclass of compounds was
assigned through a modified Mosher's ester method. For 15: , the relative
configuration was assigned based on analysis of 3J values. Compounds 1, 2, 5:
 - 14, 16: , and 17: were evaluated against the cancer cell line E006AA-hT under 
hypoxic conditions, where compound 13: inhibited cell proliferation at a
concentration of 2.5 µM.

In desmoplastic melanoma, tumor cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts are the
major dominators playing a critical role in the fibrosis morphology as well as
the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), compromising the efficacy of 
therapeutic options. To overcome this therapeutic hurdle, we developed an
innovative chemo-immunostrategy based on targeted delivery of mitoxantrone (MIT) 
and celastrol (CEL), two potent medicines screened and selected with the best
anticancer and antifibrosis potentials. Importantly, CEL worked in synergy with
MIT to induce immunogenic tumor cell death. Here, we show that when effectively
co-delivered to the tumor site at their optimal ratio by a TME-responsive
nanocarrier, the 5:1 combination of MIT and CEL significantly triggered
immunogenic tumor apoptosis and recovered tumor antigen recognition, thus
eliciting overall antitumor immunity. Furthermore, the strong synergy benefitted 
the host in reduced drug exposure and side effects. Collectively, the
nanocarrier-mediated chemo-immunotherapy successfully remodeled fibrotic and
immunosuppressive TME, arrested cancer progression, and further inhibited tumor
metastasis to major organs. The affected tumors remained dormant long after
dosing stopped, resulting in a prolonged progression-free survival and sustained 
immune surveillance of the host bearing desmoplastic melanoma.

INTRODUCTION: Internationally validated tools to measure patient-reported
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are available, but efforts to translate
and culturally validate such tools in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are scarce,
particularly among children.
METHODS: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 25-item
pediatric short form (PROMIS-25) assesses six HRQoL domains-mobility, anxiety,
depression, fatigue, peer relationships, and pain interference-by asking four
questions per domain. There is a single-item pain intensity item. The PROMIS-25
was translated into Chichewa and validated for use in Malawi using mixed
qualitative and quantitative methods. The validity and reliability of the
PROMIS-25 was assessed.
RESULTS: Fifty-four pediatric patients with lymphoma completed the PROMIS-25.
Structural validity was supported by interitem correlations and principal
component analysis. Reliability of each scale was satisfactory (range
alpha = 0.71-0.93). Known group validity testing showed that anemic children had 
worse fatigue (P = 0.016) and children with poor performance status had worse
mobility (P < 0.001) and pain interference (P = 0.005). Compared to children with
cancer in the United States, children from Malawi reported lower levels of
mobility, higher anxiety, higher depressive symptoms, higher fatigue, better
satisfaction with peer relationships, and higher pain interference.
CONCLUSION: Translation and cultural validation of the PROMIS-25 into Chichewa
for Malawi was successful. Baseline HRQoL for patients with pediatric lymphoma in
Malawi is poor for all domains except peer relationships. This emphasizes an
urgent need to address HRQoL among children undergoing cancer treatment in SSA
using self-reported instruments validated within the local context.

BACKGROUND: The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed software to gather
symptomatic adverse events directly from patients participating in clinical
trials. The software administers surveys to patients using items from the
Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (PRO-CTCAE) through Web-based or automated telephone interfaces and
facilitates the management of survey administration and the resultant data by
professionals (clinicians and research associates).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to iteratively evaluate and improve the 
usability of the PRO-CTCAE software.
METHODS: Heuristic evaluation of the software functionality was followed by
semiscripted, think-aloud protocols in two consecutive rounds of usability
testing among patients with cancer, clinicians, and research associates at 3
cancer centers. We conducted testing with patients both in clinics and at home
(remotely) for both Web-based and telephone interfaces. Furthermore, we refined
the software between rounds and retested.
RESULTS: Heuristic evaluation identified deviations from the best practices
across 10 standardized categories, which informed initial software improvement.
Subsequently, we conducted user-based testing among 169 patients and 47
professionals. Software modifications between rounds addressed identified issues,
including difficulty using radio buttons, absence of survey progress indicators, 
and login problems (for patients) as well as scheduling of patient surveys (for
professionals). The initial System Usability Scale (SUS) score for the patient
Web-based interface was 86 and 82 (P=.22) before and after modifications,
respectively, whereas the task completion score was 4.47, which improved to 4.58 
(P=.39) after modifications. Following modifications for professional users, the 
SUS scores improved from 71 to 75 (P=.47), and the mean task performance improved
significantly (4.40 vs 4.02; P=.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Software modifications, informed by rigorous assessment, rendered a 
usable system, which is currently used in multiple NCI-sponsored multicenter
cancer clinical trials.

Keratin is a family of cysteine-rich structural fibrous proteins abundantly
present in skin and skin appendages. Inspired by the template synthesis strategy,
in this work, keratin was utilized for the first time as a platform template to
synthesize metallic oxide nanoparticles, such as MnO2 (MnNPs@Keratin) and Gd2O3
(GdNPs@Keratin), in a simple and environment-benign fashion. These nanoparticles 
possess good colloid stability and biocompatibility, high T1 relaxivity ( r1
value = 6.8 mM-1s-1 for MnNPs@Keratin and 7.8 mM-1s-1 for GdNPs@Keratin), and
superior in vivo magnetic resonance imaging performance of tumor. Moreover, these
keratin-templated nanoparticles have great potential as drug carriers with the
capacity of redox-responsive drug release due to the existence of disulfide
cross-linking in keratin coating. These results suggest that keratin can be a
promising platform template for the development of metal-based nanoparticles for 
cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Brain metastases are devastating complications of cancer. The blood-brain barrier
(BBB), which protects the normal brain, morphs into an inadequately characterized
blood-tumor barrier (BTB) when brain metastases form, and is surrounded by a
neuroinflammatory response. These structures contribute to poor therapeutic
efficacy by limiting drug uptake. Here, we report that experimental breast cancer
brain metastases of low- and high permeability to a dextran dye exhibit distinct 
microenvironmental gene expression patterns. Astrocytic sphingosine-1 phosphate
receptor 3 (S1P3) is upregulated in the neuroinflammatory response of the highly 
permeable lesions, and is expressed in patients' brain metastases. S1P3
inhibition functionally tightens the BTB in vitro and in vivo. S1P3 mediates its 
effects on BTB permeability through astrocytic secretion of IL-6 and CCL2, which 
relaxes endothelial cell adhesion. Tumor cell overexpression of S1P3 mimics this 
pathway, enhancing IL-6 and CCL-2 production and elevating BTB permeability. In
conclusion, neuroinflammatory astrocytic S1P3 modulates BTB permeability.

Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) followed by radiation therapy is the current
standard of care for early stage breast cancer. Successful BCS necessitates
complete tumor resection with clear margins at the pathologic assessment of the
specimen ("no ink on tumor"). The presence of positive margins warrants
additional surgery to obtain negative final margins, which has significant
physical, psychological, and financial implications for the patient. The
challenge lies in developing accurate real-time intraoperative margin assessment 
techniques to minimize the presence of "ink on tumor" and the subsequent need for
additional surgery.

INTRODUCTION: Care for US cancer survivors is often fragmented, contributing to
poor health outcomes. Care and outcomes may improve when survivors and follow-up 
care providers receive survivorship care plans (SCPs), written documents
containing information regarding cancer diagnosis, treatment, surveillance plans,
and health promotion. However, implementing SCPs is challenging. As such, we
sought to identify strategies for successfully implementing SCPs.
METHODS: We measured SCP implementation using performance data from cancer
programs participating in the American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality
Oncology Practice Initiative, an oncologist-led quality assessment and
improvement program. We used semistructured interviews with cancer program
employees (eg, physicians) to identify strategies for successfully implementing
SCPs by comparing approaches in cancer programs that, according to Quality
Oncology Practice Initiative performance indicators, developed and delivered SCPs
to a relatively small proportion of eligible survivors and their follow-up care
providers (ie, low performers; n = 6 participants in five programs) with
approaches among programs with better performance (ie, moderate performers; n =
15 participants in nine programs).
RESULTS: Ten of 14 cancer programs developed SCPs for ≥ 50% of eligible
survivors; two of 14 delivered SCPs to any survivors; and eight of 14 delivered
SCPs to ≥ 25% of follow-up care providers. We found that moderate performers
proactively addressed SCP requirements, leveraged requirements to improve
survivorship care, set internal targets, automated implementation, had active
leaders and champions, and tasked appropriate employees with SCP implementation.
CONCLUSION: SCP implementation remains challenging. We identified strategies for 
successfully implementing SCPs. Future research should examine how cancer
programs have achieved these strategies; findings could contribute to an
understanding of the changes needed to implement comprehensive survivorship care.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is effective but underused.
Screening rates are lower among Medicaid beneficiaries versus other insured
populations. No studies have examined mailed fecal immunochemical testing
(FIT)-based outreach programs for Medicaid beneficiaries.
METHODS: In a patient-level randomized controlled trial, a mailed CRC screening
reminder plus FIT, sent from an urban health department to Medicaid
beneficiaries, was compared with the same reminder without FIT. The reminder
group could request FIT. Completed FIT kits were processed by the health
department laboratory. Respondents were notified of normal results by mail.
Abnormal results were given via phone by a patient navigator who provided
counselling and assistance with follow-up care. The primary outcome was FIT
return.
RESULTS: In all, 2144 beneficiaries at average CRC risk were identified, and
there was no evidence of screening with Medicaid claims data. To the reminder+FIT
group, 1071 were randomized, and 1073 were randomized to the reminder group; 307 
(28.7%) in the reminder+FIT group and 347 (32.3%) in the reminder group were
unreachable or ineligible (previous screening). The FIT return rate was
significantly higher in the reminder+FIT group than the reminder group (21.1% vs 
12.3%; difference, 8.8%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7%-13.9%; P < .01). Eighteen 
individuals (7.2%) who completed FIT tests had abnormal results, and 15 were
eligible for follow-up colonoscopy; 66.7% (n = 10) completed follow-up
colonoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: A health department-based, mailed FIT program targeting Medicaid
beneficiaries was feasible. Including a FIT kit resulted in greater screening
completion than a reminder letter alone. Further research is needed to understand
the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions.

The 2013 update of the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American 
Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing
guidelines recommend using an alternative chromosome 17 probe assay to resolve
HER2 results determined to be equivocal by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). However, it is unclear if cases
considered HER2-positive (HER2+) by the alternative probe method are similar to
those classified as HER2+ by traditional IHC and FISH criteria and benefit the
same from HER2-targeted therapies. We studied the clinical and pathologic
features of all 31 breast cancers classified as HER2+ by the alternative probe
method at our institution since 2013 and determined their PAM50 intrinsic
molecular subtypes. For comparison, we analyzed 19 consecutive cases that were
classified as HER2+ by traditional FISH criteria during the same time period.
Thirty (97%) cancers in the alternative probe cohort were estrogen receptor
(ER)-positive (ER+), while only 9/19 (47%) of traditional HER2 controls were ER+ 
(p = 0.0002). Sufficient tissue for intrinsic subtype analysis was available for 
20/31 cancers in the alternative probe cohort and 9/19 in the traditional HER2+
group. None (0%) of the 20 alternative probe-positive cases were of the
HER2-enriched intrinsic subtype, while 8/9 (89%) of those HER2+ by traditional
FISH criteria were HER2-enriched (p = 0.0001). These findings suggest that breast
cancers classified as HER2+ only by the alternative probe method are biologically
distinct from those classified as HER2+ by traditional criteria, and raises
questions as to whether or not they derive the same benefit from HER2-targeted
therapies.

A compounding feature of greater than 50% of all cancers is the high incidence of
the cachexia syndrome, a complex metabolic disorder characterized by extreme
weight loss due mainly to the gross depletion of skeletal muscle tissue. Although
studies into the cause of cancer cachexia has spanned over multiple decades,
little is known about the effects of various cancer treatments themselves on
cachexia. For example, chemotherapy agents induce side effects such as nausea and
anorexia, but these symptoms do not fully account for the changes seen with
cancer cachexia. In this study we examine the effects of chemotherapeutic
compounds, specifically, cisplatin in the colon-26 adenocarcinoma model of cancer
cachexia. We find that although cisplatin is able to reduce tumor burden as
expected, muscle wasting in mice nevertheless persists. Strikingly, cisplatin
alone was seen to regulate muscle atrophy, which was independent of the commonly 
implicated ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, we show that cisplatin is able
to induce NF-κB activity in both mouse muscles and myotube cultures, suggesting
that an additional side effect of cancer treatment is the regulation of muscle
wasting that may be mediated through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

The 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that is activated 
upon phosphorylation of Thr172 in its activation loop by the kinase LKB1, CAMKK2,
or TAK1. TAK1-dependent AMPK phosphorylation of Thr172 is less well characterized
than phosphorylation of this site by LKB1 or CAMKK2. An important target of TAK1 
is IκB kinase (IKK), which controls the activation of the transcription factor
NF-κB. We tested the hypothesis that IKK acted downstream of TAK1 to activate
AMPK by phosphorylating Thr172 IKK was required for the phosphorylation of Thr172
in AMPK in response to treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β or TNF-α or
upon TAK1 overexpression. In addition, IKK regulated basal AMPK Thr172
phosphorylation in several cancer cell types independently of TAK1, indicating
that other modes of IKK activation could stimulate AMPK. We found that IKK
directly phosphorylated AMPK at Thr172 independently of the tumor suppressor LKB1
or energy stress. Accordingly, in LKB1-deficient cells, IKK inhibition reduced
AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation in response to the mitochondrial inhibitor
phenformin. This response led to enhanced apoptosis and suggests that IKK
inhibition in combination with phenformin could be used clinically to treat
patients with LKB1-deficient cancers.

Multiple evidence-based approaches (EBAs) exist to improve colorectal cancer
screening in health clinics. The success of these approaches is tied to effective
implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the
implementation of EBAs for colorectal cancer screening and clinic-level
correlates of implementation in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). We
conducted descriptive and cross-sectional analyses using data collected from FQHC
clinics across seven states ( n = 51). A clinic representative completed
electronic surveys about clinic characteristics (e.g., size, patient
characteristics, and medical record system characteristics) and the
implementation of Community Guide recommended EBAs (e.g., client reminders, small
media, and provider assessment and feedback). We used bivariate Spearman
correlations to assess clinic-level correlates with implementation outcomes. Most
clinics were planning to implement, in the early implementation stages, or
inconsistently implementing EBAs. No EBA was fully implemented by more than nine 
(17.6%) clinics. Clinic size variables were inversely related to implementation
levels of one-on-one education; medical record variables were directly related to
implementation levels of client and provider reminders as well as provider
assessment and feedback; and rapid and timely feedback from clinic leaders was
directly associated with implementation levels of four out of six EBAs. Given the
varying levels of implementation, clinics need to assess current use of
implementation strategies and improve effective program delivery to increase
colorectal cancer screening among their patients. In addition, clinics should
also consider how their characteristics may support or serve as a barrier to
implementation in their respective settings.

Chromatin remodelers use bromodomains (BDs) to recognize histones. Polybromo 1
(PBRM1 or BAF180) is hypothesized to function as the nucleosome-recognition
subunit of the PBAF chromatin-remodeling complex and is frequently mutated in
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Previous studies have applied in vitro
methods to explore the binding specificities of the six individual PBRM1 BDs.
However, BD targeting to histones and the influence of neighboring BD on
nucleosome recognition have not been well characterized. Here, using histone
microarrays and intact nucleosomes to investigate the histone-binding
characteristics of the six PBRM1 BDs individually and combined, we demonstrate
that BD2 and BD4 of PBRM1 mediate binding to acetylated histone peptides and to
modified recombinant and cellular nucleosomes. Moreover, we show that neighboring
BDs variably modulate these chromatin interactions, with BD1 and BD5 enhancing
nucleosome interactions of BD2 and BD4, respectively, whereas BD3 attenuated
these interactions. We also found that binding pocket missense mutations in BD4
observed in ccRCC disrupt PBRM1-chromatin interactions and that these mutations
in BD4, but not similar mutations in BD2, in the context of full-length PBRM1,
accelerate ccRCC cell proliferation. Taken together, our biochemical and
mutational analyses have identified BD4 as being critically important for
maintaining proper PBRM1 function and demonstrate that BD4 mutations increase
ccRCC cell growth. Because of the link between PBRM1 status and sensitivity to
immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, these data also suggest the relevance of
BD4 as a potential clinical target.

Small bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) are important therapeutic molecules and
represent the first bsAb format approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration. Diabody (Db), a small bsAb format, has four possible domain
orders; we previously reported the differences in the expression levels and
cancer growth inhibition effects upon rearranging the domain order of this
format. However, there have been no comprehensive reports on domain
rearrangements of bispecific single-chain Db (scDb) and tandem single-chain Fv
(taFv), which are widely used bsAb formats. In this study, we designed all
possible domain orders for scDb and taFv (each with eight variants) with
identical Fv pairs and individually expressed all 16 variants using Escherichia
coli, Pichia pastoris, and Brevibacillus choshinensis. Comprehensive
investigations showed that the intrinsic functions of the variants were similar
to each other, regardless of the expression host system, but expression levels
varied depending on the format as well as on the host cell. Among the 16
variants, we found a promising candidate that exhibited high activity and
productivity. Furthermore, we determined that B. choshinensis is an attractive
expression host because of its secretory production of recombinant proteins.

PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine series completion rates among females
and males remain low in Florida (46.4% and 34.5%, respectively). Multiple
stakeholders influence vaccination uptake, including health care providers
(HCPs), public health professionals (PHPs), and members of professional
organizations. We examined stakeholder efforts related to increasing vaccine
uptake and education among parents/adolescents and HCPs.
METHODS: We conducted an environmental scan of stakeholder efforts and identified
stakeholders using our professional networks and a snowball sampling approach.
Stakeholders (n = 46) completed a survey about involvement in and barriers to
vaccination promotion efforts. A subset (n = 12) of stakeholders participated in 
follow-up interviews further exploring vaccination efforts and barriers. Survey
data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interview data were analyzed
using deductive analysis and coded using constructs from the PRECEDE-PROCEED
model.
RESULTS: The majority of our survey sample was PHPs (50.0%) and HCPs (32.6%).
Stakeholder efforts were focused on adolescent/parent/HCP education including
providing: educational materials for HCPs (55.8%) and adolescents/parents
(59.6%), one-on-one consultations for adolescents/parents (55.3%), and HCP
education (54.7%). Lack of knowledge/understanding and education/information were
barriers reported across almost all groups/areas. Office staff/HCP education and 
distribution of patient education materials were efforts described as important
during qualitative interviews. Stakeholders also noted HCP discomfort when
recommending HPV vaccine, parental perceptions that the vaccine is unnecessary,
and a lack of education/understanding among parents and HCPs.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the need for parent/adolescent education,
specifically targeting key areas we identified: importance and benefits of HPV
vaccine, and education and skill building in vaccine communication for HCPs.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Screening patients with cirrhosis for hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) has been recommended. We conducted a matched case-control study within the 
US Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system to determine whether screening by
abdominal ultrasonography (USS) and/or by measuring serum level of α-fetoprotein 
(AFP) was associated with decreased cancer-related mortality in patients with
cirrhosis.
METHODS: We defined cases (n = 238) as patients with cirrhosis who died of HCC
from January 1, 2013 through August 31, 2015 and had been in VA care with a
diagnosis of cirrhosis for at least 4 years before the diagnosis of HCC. We
matched each case to 1 control (n = 238), defined as a patient with cirrhosis who
did not die of HCC and had been in VA care for at least 4 years before the date
of the matched case's HCC diagnosis. Controls were matched to cases by year of
cirrhosis diagnosis, race and ethnicity, age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, Model
for End-Stage Liver Disease score, and VA medical center. We identified all USS
and serum AFP tests performed within 4 years before the date of HCC diagnosis in 
cases or the equivalent index date in controls and determined by chart extraction
(blinded to case or control status) whether these tests were performed for
screening.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between cases and controls in the 
proportions of patients who underwent screening USS (52.9% vs 54.2%), screening
measurement of serum AFP (74.8% vs 73.5%), screening USS or measurement of serum 
AFP (81.1% vs 79.4%), or screening USS and measurement of serum AFP (46.6% vs
48.3%) within 4 years before the index date, with or without adjusting for
potential confounders. There also was no difference in receipt of these screening
tests within 1, 2, or 3 years before the index date.
CONCLUSIONS: In a matched case-control study of the VA health care system, we
found that screening patients with cirrhosis for HCC by USS, measurement of serum
AFP, either test, or both tests was not associated with decreased HCC-related
mortality. We encourage additional case-control studies to evaluate the efficacy 
of screening for HCC in other health care systems, in which available records are
sufficiently detailed to enable identification of the indication for USS and AFP 
tests.

INTRODUCTION: Muscle wasting has detrimental effects, including increased
mortality. Identifying patients at risk can guide treatment efforts.
METHODS: POWER 1 and 2 were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multinational phase III trials that studied 600 patients with lung cancer at the 
start of chemotherapy; the studies' aim was to assess the efficacy of enobosarm
on prevention and treatment of muscle loss. We performed a secondary analysis
restricted to the control group, using a cumulative logit model for ordinal
outcome to determine which baseline characteristics predicted physical and
functional loss during chemotherapy.
RESULTS: In all, 53% of patients had loss of lean body mass and 49% had loss of
stair climb power (SCP) at day 84 of treatment. Of the 322 patients who received 
placebo, 232 with observable outcome and baseline covariates were included for
lean body mass analysis and 236 for SCP analysis. More advanced disease predicted
a higher probability of greater physical loss (OR = 1.96; 95% confidence interval
[CI]: 1.14-3.36). Three factors predicted higher probability of SCP loss: taxane 
chemotherapy (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.06-2.83), tobacco use before chemotherapy
(OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.10-4.18), and SCP at baseline (OR = 1.01, 95% CI:
1.004-1.015). Higher body mass index was a protective factor for functional loss 
(OR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73-0.98). A higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
Performance Status trended toward being predictive of greater probability of both
physical loss (0.767) and functional loss (0.070), but the results were not
statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 50% of patients with advanced lung cancer who were
undergoing chemotherapy had ongoing loss of muscle mass and muscle function.
Advanced stage predicted physical loss. Tobacco use and taxane chemotherapy
predicted functional loss. Body mass index was a protective factor for functional
loss. We identified predictors of physical and functional loss that could be used
as therapeutic targets or to guide treatment efforts.

A greater understanding of the nature and drivers of poor breast cancer (BC)
awareness in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) will inform much needed awareness
programmes. We aimed to assess the level and nature of BC awareness in the
multi-country African Breast Cancer-Disparities in Outcome (ABC-DO) cohort of
women newly diagnosed with BC during 2014-2017. Awareness indicators were
assessed during a baseline interview at/near diagnosis. Logistic/ordinal
regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for indicators of BC awareness
in relation to woman-level characteristics for individual settings and then
meta-analyzed. In the 1,451 women included, almost all Namibian non-black women
(n = 104) knew of BC and its curability, while in Namibian black and Zambian
women, one in 7 (~ 15%) had not previously heard of BC and 25-40% did not know it
was curable. In Uganda and Nigeria awareness was lowest: one in four women had no
BC awareness, and 2 in 3 had no knowledge of its cure potential. Low educational 
level, unskilled employment, low socioeconomic position, rural residence, older
age, being unmarried, and in some settings HIV-positivity, were associated with
lower BC awareness-e.g., having unskilled employment was associated with not
having heard of BC (summary OR 3.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17-5.23),
believing that it is incurable (2.43; 1.81-3.26), and not recognizing a breast
lump symptom (1.85; 1.41-2.43) but with between-setting variation (I2 > 68% for
all). The findings provide evidence of the level and difference in BC awareness
and beliefs across different settings, highlighting the urgent need for
context-specific education programmes in the SSA region.

Although successes in cancer immunotherapy have generated considerable
excitement, this form of treatment has been largely ineffective in patients with 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Mechanisms that contribute to the poor
antitumor immune response in PDA are not well understood. Here, we demonstrated
that cytokine IL35 is a major immunosuppressive driver in PDA and potentiates
tumor growth via the suppression of endogenous antitumor T-cell responses. The
growth of pancreatic tumors in mice deficient for IL35 was significantly reduced.
An analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells revealed a role for IL35 in the
expansion of regulatory T cells and the suppression of CD4+ effector T cells. We 
also detected a robust increase in both the infiltration and activation of
cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, suggesting that targeting IL35 may be an effective
strategy to convert PDA from an immunologically "cold" to "hot" tumor. Although
PDA is typically resistant to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, we demonstrated robust
synergistic reduction in tumor growth when IL35 deficiency was combined with
anti-PD-1 treatment. These findings provide new insight into the function of IL35
in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer and underscore the potential
significance of IL35 as a therapeutic target for use in combination immunotherapy
approaches in this deadly malignancy. Cancer Immunol Res; 6(9); 1014-24. ©2018

CHIP E3 ligase mediates proteasomal degradation of the proliferation regulatory
protein ALDH1L1 during the transition of NIH3T3 fibroblasts from G0/G1 to

ALDH1L1 is a folate-metabolizing enzyme abundant in liver and several other
tissues. In human cancers and cell lines derived from malignant tumors, the
ALDH1L1 gene is commonly silenced through the promoter methylation. It was
suggested that ALDH1L1 limits proliferation capacity of the cell and thus
functions as putative tumor suppressor. In contrast to cancer cells, mouse cell
lines NIH3T3 and AML12 do express the ALDH1L1 protein. In the present study, we
show that the levels of ALDH1L1 in these cell lines fluctuate throughout the cell
cycle. During S-phase, ALDH1L1 is markedly down regulated at the protein level.
As the cell cultures become confluent and cells experience increased contact
inhibition, ALDH1L1 accumulates in the cells. In agreement with this finding,
NIH3T3 cells arrested in G1/S-phase by a thymidine block completely lose the
ALDH1L1 protein. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prevents such
loss in proliferating NIH3T3 cells, suggesting the proteasomal degradation of the
ALDH1L1 protein. The co-localization of ALDH1L1 with proteasomes, demonstrated by
confocal microscopy, supports this mechanism. We further show that ALDH1L1
interacts with the chaperone-dependent E3 ligase CHIP, which plays a key role in 
the ALDH1L1 ubiquitination and degradation. In NIH3T3 cells, silencing of CHIP by
siRNA halts, while transient expression of CHIP promotes, the ALDH1L1 loss. The
downregulation of ALDH1L1 is associated with the accumulation of the ALDH1L1
substrate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, which is required for de novo purine
biosynthesis, a key pathway activated in S-phase. Overall, our data indicate that
CHIP-mediated proteasomal degradation of ALDH1L1 facilitates cellular
proliferation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate blue-light flexible cystoscopy (BLFC) with
hexaminolevulinate in the office surveillance of patients with
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer with a high risk of recurrence by assessing
its impact on pain, anxiety, subjective value of the test and patient willingness
to pay.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicentre, phase III study was conducted 
during which the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS) Anxiety, Pain and 'Was It Worth It' questionnaires were administered at 
baseline, after surveillance with BLFC and after resection for those referred to 
the operating room. Comparisons of scores were performed between groups.
RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were enrolled, of whom 103 were referred for
surgical examination. Of these, 63 were found to have histologically confirmed
malignancy. Pain levels were low throughout the study. Anxiety levels decreased
after BLFC (∆ = -2.6), with a greater decrease among those with negative
pathology results (P = 0.051). No differences in anxiety were noted based on
gender, BLFC results, or test performance (true-positive/false-positive). Most
patients found BLFC 'worthwhile' (94%), would 'do it again' (94%) and 'would
recommend it to others' (91%), with no differences based on BLFC results or test 
performance. Most patients undergoing BLFC (76%) were willing to pay out of
pocket.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety decreased after BLFC in patients with negative pathology,
including patients with false-positive results. Most of the patients undergoing
BLFC were willing to pay out of pocket, found the procedure worthwhile and would 
recommend it to others, irrespective of whether they had a positive BLFC result
or whether this was false-positive after surgery.

Immune checkpoint blockade, which blocks the regulatory pathways that express on 
immune cells to improve antitumor immunological responses, is becoming one of the
most promising approaches for antitumor therapy. This therapy has achieved
important clinical advancement and provided a new opportunity against a variety
of cancers. However, limitations of checkpoint inhibitors application, including 
the risk of autoimmune disease, low objective response rates, and high cost,
still largely affect their broad applications in patients. Therefore, it is
desirable to seek effective delivery methods to further enhance the therapeutic
efficacy and reduce drawbacks of immune checkpoint blockade. This brief review
summarizes strategies to increase the antitumor immunity, including the local and
targeted delivery of checkpoint inhibitors, and a combination of different
checkpoint inhibitors or with other therapeutic treatments.

Importance: Preferential delivery of docetaxel to tumors by prostate-specific
membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted nanoparticles is clinically effective, and the
selective reduction of PSMA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) after
treatment has implications for patient selection and disease monitoring.
Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of BIND-014, a PSMA-directed
docetaxel-containing nanoparticle, in patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Design, Setting, and Participants: A multicenter open-label, phase 2 clinical
trial of 42 chemotherapy-naive patients with progressing mCRPC after treatment
with abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide was conducted from June 24, 2013, to
June 10, 2016.
Intervention: Treatment with BIND-014 at a dosage of 60 mg/m2 was given
intravenously on day 1 of 21-day cycles in combination with prednisone until
disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects occurred.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was radiographic
progression-free survival according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2
recommendations and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.
Secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50%
reduction from baseline) and changes in CTC number (from ≥5 to <5 cells per 7.5
mL of blood) (CellSearch). Changes in CTC number based on PSMA expression levels 
on CTCs were also evaluated (Epic Sciences).
Results: Among the 42 patients (81% white), the median age was 66 (range, 50-85) 
years, and median number of doses received was 6 (range, 1-21). A PSA response
was observed in 12 of 40 patients (30%; 95% CI, 18%-45%), measurable disease
response in 6 of 19 (32% [95% CI, 15%-54%]), and CTC conversions in 13 of 26
(50%; 95% CI, 32%-68%). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 9.9
(95% CI, 7.1-12.6) months. With use of the Epic Sciences non-EPCAM-based CTC
detection platform, CTCs were detected in 16 of 18 patients (89%); 11 of 18 (61%)
had CTCs with PSMA expression above the analytical threshold level (PSMA
positive) at baseline (range, 0.4-72.4 CTCs/mL). After treatment, PSMA-positive
CTCs were preferentially reduced. Treatment-related adverse events included grade
1 or 2 fatigue (29 of 42 patients [69%]), nausea (23 [55%]), neuropathy (14
[33%]), and neutropenic fever (1 [2%]).
Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that treatment with BIND-014 is
active and well tolerated in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Antitumor
activity may be related to PSMA expression levels on CTCs, which suggests that
patients who are likely to benefit from this treatment can be identified before
treatment is initiated.

BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy is the surgical standard for invasive bladder
cancer. Robot-assisted cystectomy has been proposed to provide similar
oncological outcomes with lower morbidity. We aimed to compare progression-free
survival in patients with bladder cancer treated with open cystectomy and
robot-assisted cystectomy.
METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3
trial done in 15 medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants (aged ≥18
years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer or
refractory carcinoma in situ. Individuals who had previously had open abdominal
or pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that would
preclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded.
Patients were centrally assigned (1:1) via a web-based system, with block
randomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical T
stage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receive
robot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporeal 
urinary diversion. Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists. The
primary endpoint was 2-year progression-free survival, with non-inferiority
established if the lower bound of the one-sided 97·5% CI for the treatment
difference (robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy) was greater than -15
percentage points. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population. 
Safety was assessed in the same population. This trial is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01157676.
FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2011, and Nov 18, 2014, 350 participants were randomly 
assigned to treatment. The intended treatment was robotic cystectomy in 176
patients and open cystectomy in 174 patients. 17 (10%) of 176 patients in the
robotic cystectomy group did not have surgery and nine (5%) patients had a
different surgery to that they were assigned. 21 (12%) of 174 patients in the
open cystectomy group did not have surgery and one (1%) patient had robotic
cystectomy instead of open cystectomy. Thus, 302 patients (150 in the robotic
cystectomy group and 152 in the open cystectomy group) were included in the
per-protocol analysis set. 2-year progression-free survival was 72·3% (95% CI
64·3 to 78·8) in the robotic cystectomy group and 71·6% (95% CI 63·6 to 78·2) in 
the open cystectomy group (difference 0·7%, 95% CI -9·6% to 10·9%;
pnon-inferiority=0·001), indicating non-inferiority of robotic cystectomy.
Adverse events occurred in 101 (67%) of 150 patients in the robotic cystectomy
group and 105 (69%) of 152 patients in the open cystectomy group. The most common
adverse events were urinary tract infection (53 [35%] in the robotic cystectomy
group vs 39 [26%] in the open cystectomy group) and postoperative ileus (33 [22%]
in the robotic cystectomy group vs 31 [20%] in the open cystectomy group).
INTERPRETATION: In patients with bladder cancer, robotic cystectomy was
non-inferior to open cystectomy for 2-year progression-free survival. Increased
adoption of robotic surgery in clinical practice should lead to future randomised
trials to assess the true value of this surgical approach in patients with other 
cancer types.

Factors influencing melanoma survival include sex, age, clinical stage, lymph
node involvement, as well as Breslow thickness, presence of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes based on histological analysis of primary melanoma, mitotic rate, and
ulceration. Identification of genes whose expression in primary tumors is
associated with these key tumor/patient characteristics can shed light on
molecular mechanisms of melanoma survival. Here, we show results from a gene
expression analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary melanomas with
extensive clinical annotation. The Cancer Genome Atlas data on primary melanomas 
were used for validation of nominally significant associations. We identified
five genes that were significantly associated with the presence of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the joint analysis after adjustment for
multiple testing: IL1R2, PPL, PLA2G3, RASAL1, and SGK2. We also identified two
genes significantly associated with melanoma metastasis to the regional lymph
nodes (PIK3CG and IL2RA), and two genes significantly associated with sex (KDM5C 
and KDM6A). We found that LEF1 was significantly associated with Breslow
thickness and CCNA2 and UBE2T with mitosis. RAD50 was the gene most significantly
associated with survival, with a higher level of expression associated with worse
survival.

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and
key regulator of cell cycle progression. Since APC/C promotes the degradation of 
mitotic cyclins, it controls cell cycle-dependent oscillations in
cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Both CDKs and APC/C control a large
number of substrates and are regulated by analogous mechanisms, including
cofactor-dependent activation. However, whereas substrate dephosphorylation is
known to counteract CDK, it remains largely unknown whether deubiquitinating
enzymes (DUBs) antagonize APC/C substrate ubiquitination during mitosis. Here, we
demonstrate that Cezanne/OTUD7B is a cell cycle-regulated DUB that opposes the
ubiquitination of APC/C targets. Cezanne is remarkably specific for K11-linked
ubiquitin chains, which are formed by APC/C in mitosis. Accordingly, Cezanne
binds established APC/C substrates and reverses their APC/C-mediated
ubiquitination. Cezanne depletion accelerates APC/C substrate degradation and
causes errors in mitotic progression and formation of micronuclei. These data
highlight the importance of tempered APC/C substrate destruction in maintaining
chromosome stability. Furthermore, Cezanne is recurrently amplified and
overexpressed in numerous malignancies, suggesting a potential role in genome
maintenance and cancer cell proliferation.

Historically, through the conduct of prospective clinical trials, breast cancer
surgeons have performed less radical breast and axillary surgeries with no
survival decrement to our patients. Currently, other opportunities exist for the 
treating breast surgeon to do less. Possibilities include active surveillance for
ductal carcinoma in situ, ablative therapy for small primary breast cancers,
selective omission of a sentinel node biopsy, and selective elimination of breast
surgery after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Breast surgeons must be leaders in
the development and testing of effective therapy with the least intervention
possible.

Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating cancer symptoms, and is
associated with impaired quality of life. The exact pathophysiology of
cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is poorly understood, but in any individual, it is
likely multifactorial and involves inter-related cytokine, muscular,
neurotransmitter, and neuroendocrine changes. Underlying CRF mechanisms proposed 
include central and peripheral hypotheses. Central mechanisms include hypotheses 
about cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis disruption,
circadian rhythm disruption, serotonin, and vagal afferent nerve function while
peripheral mechanisms include hypotheses about adenosine triphosphate and muscle 
contractile properties. Currently, these hypotheses are largely based on evidence
from other conditions in which fatigue is characteristic. The purpose of this
article is to provide a narrative review of the literature and present the
current controversies in the pathophysiology of CRF, particularly in relation to 
central and peripheral hypotheses for CRF. An understanding of pathophysiology
may facilitate direct and simple therapeutic interventions for those with cancer.

BACKGROUND: Although uterine size has been a previously cited barrier to
minimally invasive hysterectomy, experienced gynecologic surgeons have been able 
to demonstrate that laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy is feasible with
increasingly large uteri. By demonstrating that minimally invasive hysterectomy
continues to have superior outcomes even with increased uterine weights,
opportunity exists to meaningfully decrease morbidity, mortality, and cost
associated with abdominal hysterectomy.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if there is an association between uterine
weight and posthysterectomy complications and if differences in that association 
exist across vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal approaches.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cohort study of prospectively collected quality
improvement data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program database, composed of patient information and 30-day
postoperative outcomes from >500 hospitals across the United States and targeted 
data files, which includes additional data on procedure-specific risk factors and
outcomes in >100 of those participating hospitals. We analyzed patients
undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions from 2014 through 2015, identified 
by Current Procedural Terminology code. We excluded patients who had cancer,
surgery by a nongynecology specialty, or missing uterine weight. Patients were
compared with respect to 30-day postoperative complications and uterine weight,
stratified by surgical approach. Bivariable tests and multivariable logistic
regression were used for analysis.
RESULTS: In all, 27,167 patients were analyzed. After adjusting for potential
confounders, including medical and surgical variables, women with 500-g uteri
were >30% more likely to have complications compared to women with uteri ≤100 g
(adjusted odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-1.54; P < .0001), women
with 750-g uteri were nearly 60% as likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95%
confidence interval, 1.37-1.82; P < .0001), and women with uteri ≥1000 g were
>80% more likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.21; 
P < .0001). The incidence of 30-day postsurgical complications was nearly double 
in the abdominal hysterectomy group (15%) compared to the laparoscopic group
(8%). Additionally, for each stratum of uterine weight, abdominal hysterectomy
had significantly higher odds of any complication compared to laparoscopic
hysterectomy, even after adjusting for potential demographic, medical, and
surgical confounders. For uteri <250 g, abdominal hysterectomy had twice the odds
of any complication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio, 
2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.80-2.33), and among women with uteri between
250-500 g, abdominal hysterectomy was associated with an almost 80% increase in
odds of any complication (adjusted odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval,
1.41-2.19). Even among women with uteri >500 g, abdominal hysterectomy was still 
associated with a >30% increased odds of any complication, compared to
laparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval,
1.07-1.71).
CONCLUSION: We found that while uterine weight was an independent risk factor for
posthysterectomy complications, abdominal hysterectomy had higher odds of any
complication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, even for markedly enlarged
uteri. Our study suggests that uterine weight alone is not an appropriate
indication for abdominal hysterectomy. We also identified that it is safe to
perform larger hysterectomies laparoscopically. Patients may benefit from
referral to experienced surgeons who are able to offer laparoscopic hysterectomy 
even for markedly enlarged uteri.

INTRODUCTION: Arab Americans are a growing population in the United States. In
the 2011 American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were
close to 1.8 million Arab Americans living within the United States, a 47%
increase in population size from 2000. According to the Arab American Institute, 
currently, that estimate has grown to approximately 3.7 million. They have high
rates of smoking and low rates of smoking cessation. In this study, the
researchers investigated factors influencing desire to quit smoking among Arab
Americans, and their association with acculturation and health beliefs.
METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional descriptive study investigating smoking behaviors
and factors influencing the desire to quit smoking among adult Arab American.
Data were collected to measure tobacco use, nicotine dependence, desire to quit
smoking, acculturation, and health beliefs.
RESULTS: The sample ( N = 96) was 55% female, mean age of 44 years (±14.79). The 
desire to quit smoking was positively associated with perceived severity (p <
.05) and susceptibility to cancer (p < .05), perceived benefits of quitting
smoking ( p < .01); and negatively associated with smoking barriers (addiction
barriers p < .05, external barriers p = .27, internal barriers p < .05), and
nicotine dependence (p < .05). Being female, having a lower level of nicotine
dependence, and a higher perception of cancer severity predicted higher desire to
quit smoking ( p < .01).
DISCUSSION: Smoking cessation intervention studies need to target appropriate
health beliefs, especially the high risk of cancer caused by smoking among Arab
Americans.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that suicide rates are elevated among 
cancer patients relative to the general population. In this analysis, we
comprehensively evaluated characteristics associated with higher suicide rates
among patients with cancers of the digestive system.
METHODS: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
database, we identified all patients diagnosed with digestive system cancers
during 2000 to 2014. Patients were classified as having died of suicide if their 
cause of death in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results was listed as
"suicide and self-inflicted injury." Suicide rates were compared to age-, sex-,
and race-adjusted rates in the general population.
RESULTS: A total of 881 suicides were identified among 856 293 patients diagnosed
with digestive system cancers. The suicide rate in this population was 32.8 per
100 000 person-years and was nearly twice that in the general population
(standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.79-2.04). Suicide rates
were significantly elevated for all cancer sites but were highest for esophageal 
(SMR = 5.03), pancreatic (SMR = 5.28), stomach (SMR = 2.84), and liver
(SMR = 2.14) cancers. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide were highest
within the first 5 years of diagnosis and increased with age at diagnosis for all
sites except colon and stomach.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancers of the digestive system have a higher
incidence of suicide than the general population. Suicide rates among esophageal 
and pancreatic cancer patients are more than 5 times general population rates.
The involvement of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals may be a
critical component of cancer care for these high-risk patient subgroups.

Cabozantinib is a multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of metastatic 
medullary thyroid cancer and advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients who 
have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy. While associations between serum
creatine kinase (CK) elevations and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for the
treatment of solid malignancies have been previously reported, we report a case
of cabozantinib-associated CK elevation that was associated with musculoskeletal 
complaints by an RCC patient. Nine days following initiation of cabozantinib, the
patient reported muscle cramps and serum CK had increased from levels 12 months
earlier that were within normal limits to a grade 1 elevation of 244 units/L.
Despite a dose reduction, her CK continued to rise over the next 2 months,
leading to a peak CK of 914 units/L. Due to this grade 3 elevation, cabozantinib 
was permanently discontinued, and her CK subsequently returned to a grade 1
elevation within one week and then to baseline within 3 weeks. The temporal
relationship between drug exposure and CK increase strongly suggests causality.
To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of CK elevation
attributed to cabozantinib, but cabozantinib-induced CK elevations could be
under-reported, and providers should monitor for musculoskeletal complaints
during cabozantinib therapy.

Mutations in tumor suppressor TP53 have been inconsistently linked to breast
cancer risk factors and survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, a primary 
clinical means of TP53 mutation determination, only detects mutations that
facilitate protein accumulation (e.g., missense mutations). RNA-based pathway
methods capture functional status and may aid in understanding the role of TP53
function in racial disparities of breast cancer. TP53 status was assessed among
invasive breast cancer cases from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS)
(2008-2013) using IHC and an established RNA-based TP53 signature (CBCS and The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)). Frequency of TP53 status (IHC, RNA-based) was
estimated in association with tumor characteristics, PAM50 intrinsic subtype,
age, and race using relative frequency differences (RFDs) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) as the measure of association. Approximately 60% of basal-like
tumors were TP53 protein positive (IHC), while nearly 100% were TP53 mutant-like 
(RNA). Luminal A tumors had low frequency of TP53 positivity (IHC: 7.9%) and
mutant-like status (RNA: 1.7%). Mutant-like TP53 (RNA) was strongly associated
with age ≤50 years, high tumor grade, advanced stage of disease, large tumor
size, and basal-like and HER2 intrinsic subtypes. Black race was strongly
associated with TP53 mutant-like status (RNA) (RFD: 24.8%, 95% CI: 20.5, 29.0)
even after adjusting for age, grade, stage (RFD: 11.3%; 95% CI: 7.6, 15.0).
Associations were attenuated and non-significant when measured by IHC. IHC-based 
TP53 status is an insensitive measurement of TP53 functional status. RNA-based
methods suggest a role for TP53 in tumor prognostic features and racial
disparities.

Survivorship care plans (SCPs)-documents intended to improve care for cancer
survivors who have completed active treatment-are required, yet implementation is
poor. We sought to understand SCP implementation in cancer programs in the USA
with the objective of identifying opportunities for improvement. We recruited
cancer care providers in the USA via several cancer care networks to participate 
in a survey regarding SCP implementation. We used descriptive statistics to
analyze the data. Three hundred ninety-five providers from diverse cancer
programs in 47 states and Washington, DC responded to the survey. The timing of
SCP implementation varied across and within cancer programs, with approximately
40% of respondents reporting developing SCPs more than 3 months after primary
treatment or adjuvant therapy completion. Nurse navigators were responsible for
48-58% of each stage of SCP implementation. Processes that could have been
automated often occurred in-person or via phone and vice versa. Respondents
reported spending more than 2 h per SCP to complete all stages of implementation,
of which less than a third was reimbursed by third-party payers. We identified
several opportunities for improving SCP implementation, including broadening the 
base of responsibility, optimizing modes of communication, decreasing the time
required and increasing the funding available, and limiting variation in SCP
implementation across and within cancer programs. Future work should assess the
influence of approaches to SCP implementation on desired outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancers represent a
distinct subtype of gastric cancers and account for nearly 10% of the gastric
cancer burden, yet risk detection strategies for this cancer subtype are lacking.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study where we assayed 4 EBV antigens
[viral capsid antigen (VCA), early antigen (EA), Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen
(EBNA), and BZLF1-encoded replication activator protein (ZEBRA)] in either sera
or plasma from 1447 gastric cancer cases and 1797 controls obtained from seven
prospective cohorts representing individuals from the high gastric cancer-risk
countries of China, Japan, and Korea.
RESULTS: The prevalence of EBV sero-positivity was universal with the exception
of one sero-negative individual, and the highest titers of the EBV antigens VCA
(OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78-1.17), EBNA (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72-1.08), EA (OR 0.97, 95%
CI 0.79-1.19), and ZEBRA (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71-1.07) were not associated with
risk of incident gastric cancer. When we stratified these data by H. pylori
status, there was no change in the association.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex serology of the aforementioned EBV antigens in serum may
not be a suitable biomarker for predicting gastric cancer risk in East Asian
populations.

INTRODUCTION: Daily self-weighing (DSW) and daily activity tracking (DAT) are
useful strategies for preventing weight gain among African American breast cancer
survivors. However, self-monitoring behaviors vary over time, increasing risk of 
weight gain. This study explored the association of nonadherence to DSW and DAT
with corresponding weight fluctuations among African American breast cancer
survivors.
METHODS: Using data from a 6-month randomized controlled trial, we conducted a
secondary data analysis among women randomized into a DSW group (n = 13) and a
DSW+DAT group (n = 11). DSW and DAT were captured from wireless scale and
activity tracker data. Nonadherence to DSW was defined as one or more days
without a weight measurement, and nonadherence to DAT was defined as one or more 
days without activity tracking. Generalized estimating equations were used to
examine weight fluctuations in relation to nonadherence to DSW and DAT. Data
analysis occurred from September 2016-April 2017.
RESULTS: Over the 6-month study period, women provided 119.2 ± 46.0 weight
measurements and 121.9 ± 53.2 days of physical activity tracking. Nonadherence to
DSW was associated with weight fluctuations. For every 1-day increase in
nonadherence to DSW, weight increased by 0.031 kg (95% CI: 0.012, 0.050; p<0.01).
Additionally, during periods of DSW and DAT weight decreased by 0.028 kg (95% CI:
-0.042, -0.014; p<0.001) and 0.017 kg (95% CI: -0.030; -0.004) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that nonadherence to DSW was associated with
weight gain among breast cancer survivors. Weight loss was enhanced during
periods of DSW and DAT.

PURPOSE: To investigate the use of electronic patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to
assess symptoms and how they can provide opportunities to clinicians to address
symptoms in a timely manner to improve clinical care. As part of a larger study
to evaluate whether providing standardized symptom reports to the medical team
would decrease the time to treatment of reported symptoms in hematopoietic
stem-cell transplant recipients, we assessed nurses' and providers' perceptions
of electronic symptom reporting.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews of RNs, MDs, NPs and PAs were conducted at an 
academic cancer center in the southeastern United States. Nurses' and providers' 
perceptions of electronic symptom reporting were explored. Interviews were
audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded by two investigators to identify major
themes.
RESULTS: Fourteen RNs and seven providers (MDs, PAs, and NPs) participated in the
interviews. Three main themes emerged from the interviews: electronic symptom
reporting may improve assessment and care, integrating symptom reporting into
nurse workflow presents difficulties, and there are barriers for completion of
surveys.
CONCLUSION: The majority of nurses and providers believed that the inclusion of
electronic symptom reporting in bone marrow transplantation inpatient units has
the potential to improve care but that barriers to implementation remain.

Cancer immunotherapy is a powerful, growing treatment approach to cancer that can
be combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and oncosurgery. Modulating the
immune system to enhance anticancer response by several strategies has yielded
improved cancer survival. Despite this progress, the success rate for
immunotherapy has been below expectations due to unpredictable efficacy and
off-target side effects from systemic dosing. Nanotechnology offers numerous
different materials and targeting properties to overcome many of these challenges
in immunotherapy. In this chapter, we review current immunotherapy and its
challenges as well as the latest nanotechnology applications in cancer
immunotherapy.

Bayesian design of a survival trial with a cured fraction using historical data.

Psioda MA(1), Ibrahim JG(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 27599,
North Carolina, USA.

In this paper, we develop a general Bayesian clinical trial design methodology,
tailored for time-to-event trials with a cured fraction in scenarios where a
previously completed clinical trial is available to inform the design and
analysis of the new trial. Our methodology provides a conceptually appealing and 
computationally feasible framework that allows one to construct a fixed,
maximally informative prior a priori while simultaneously identifying the minimum
sample size required for the new trial so that the design has high power and
reasonable type I error control from a Bayesian perspective. This strategy is
particularly well suited for scenarios where adaptive borrowing approaches are
not practical due to the nature of the trial, complexity of the model, or the
source of the prior information. Control of a Bayesian type I error rate offers a
sensible balance between wanting to use high-quality information in the design
and analysis of future trials while still controlling type I errors in an
equitable way. Moreover, sample size determination based on our Bayesian view of 
power can lead to a more adequately sized trial by virtue of taking into account 
all the uncertainty in the treatment effect. We demonstrate our methodology by
designing a cancer clinical trial in high-risk melanoma.

PURPOSE: HER2 + breast cancer (BC) is an aggressive subtype with high rates of
brain metastases (BCBM). Two-thirds of HER2 + BCBM demonstrate activation of the 
PI3K/mTOR pathway driving resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. This phase II study
evaluated everolimus (E), a brain-permeable mTOR inhibitor, trastuzumab (T), and 
vinorelbine (V) in patients with HER2 + BCBM.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had progressive HER2 + BCBM. The primary 
endpoint was intracranial response rate (RR); secondary objectives were CNS
clinical benefit rate (CBR), extracranial RR, time to progression (TTP), overall 
survival (OS), and targeted sequencing of tumors from enrolled patients. A
two-stage design distinguished intracranial RR of 5% versus 20%.
RESULTS: 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity, 26 for efficacy. Intracranial
RR was 4% (1 PR). CNS CBR at 6 mos was 27%; at 3 mos 65%. Median intracranial TTP
was 3.9 mos (95% CI 2.2-5). OS was 12.2 mos (95% CI 0.6-20.2). Grade 3-4
toxicities included neutropenia (41%), anemia (16%), and stomatitis (16%).
Mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were common in BCBM. Mutations in the PI3K/mTOR
pathway were not associated with response. ERBB2 amplification was higher in BCBM
compared to primary BC; ERBB2 amplification in the primary BC trended toward
worse OS.
CONCLUSION: While intracranial RR to ETV was low in HER2 + BCBM patients,
one-third achieved CNS CBR; TTP/OS was similar to historical control. No new
toxicity signals were observed. Further analysis of the genomic underpinnings of 
BCBM to identify tractable prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers is warranted.

Cancer progression is the most relevant phase of carcinogenesis due to the
development of malignant tumors in the host. Some viruses participate in
malignant cell transformation, with recent compelling evidence suggesting that
oncoviruses also have a role in cancer progression. The human hepatitis B (HBV)
and C (HCV) viruses, human papillomaviruses (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and 
Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) are the most important human oncoviruses
currently known. Here, we discuss how oncoviruses can modulate cancer
progression, such as tumor growth, invasion, and cancer metastasis.

BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients with esophageal cancer is expected to 
increase. We aimed to determine the postoperative outcomes of esophagectomy for
esophageal cancer in elderly patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, population-based analysis was performed
using the National inpatient sample for the period 2000-2014. Adult patients ≥18 
years old (yo) diagnosed with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy
during their inpatient hospitalization were included. Patients were categorized
into <70 yo and ≥70 yo. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used
to assess the potential effect of age on postoperative complications, inpatient
mortality, and hospital charges.
RESULTS: Overall, 5243 patients were included, with 3699 (70.6%) <70 yo and 1544 
(29.5%) ≥70 yo. The yearly rate of esophagectomies among patients ≥70 yo did not 
significantly changed during the study period (28.4% in 2000 and 26.3% in 2014,
P = 0.76). Elderly patients were significantly more likely to have postoperative 
cardiac failure (odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21, 2.09,
P = 0.0009) and inpatient mortality (odds ratio 1.84, 95% CI 1.39, 2.45,
P < 0.0001). Among the elderly patients, hospital charges were, on average,
$16,320 greater (95% CI $3110, $29,530) than patients <70 yo (P = 0.02). The
predicted probability of mortality increased consistently across age (1.5% in 40 
yo, 2.5% in 50 yo, 3.6% in 60 yo, 5.4% in 70 yo, and 7.0% in 80 yo).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer have a
significantly higher risk of postoperative mortality and pose a higher financial 
burden on the health care system. Elderly patients with esophageal cancer should 
be carefully selected for surgery.

Importance: The association between increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and risk of breast
cancer is unique in cancer epidemiology in that a crossover effect exists, with
risk reduction before and risk increase after menopause. The inverse association 
with premenopausal breast cancer risk is poorly characterized but might be
important in the understanding of breast cancer causation.
Objective: To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancer
risk, in particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer, 
and tumor characteristics.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter analysis used pooled
individual-level data from 758 592 premenopausal women from 19 prospective
cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer in
association with BMI from ages 18 through 54 years using Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis. Median follow-up was 9.3 years (interquartile range,
4.9-13.5 years) per participant, with 13 082 incident cases of breast cancer.
Participants were recruited from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013, and 
data were analyzed from September 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017.
Exposures: Body mass index at ages 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54
years.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Invasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer.
Results: Among the 758 592 premenopausal women (median age, 40.6 years;
interquartile range, 35.2-45.5 years) included in the analysis, inverse linear
associations of BMI with breast cancer risk were found that were stronger for BMI
at ages 18 to 24 years (HR per 5 kg/m2 [5.0-U] difference, 0.77; 95% CI,
0.73-0.80) than for BMI at ages 45 to 54 years (HR per 5.0-U difference, 0.88;
95% CI, 0.86-0.91). The inverse associations were observed even among
nonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest and
lowest BMI categories (BMI≥35.0 vs <17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95%
CI, 0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or between
strata of other breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger for
estrogen receptor-positive and/or progesterone receptor-positive than for hormone
receptor-negative breast cancer for BMI at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18
to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen receptor-positive and
progesterone receptor-positive tumors, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs hormone
receptor-negative tumors, 0.85 [95% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 years
was not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor-negative
breast cancer overall.
Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that increased
adiposity is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at a
greater magnitude than previously shown and across the entire distribution of
BMI. The strongest associations of risk were observed for BMI in early adulthood.
Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations could have 
important preventive potential.

Differences in tumor characteristics might partially account for mortality
disparities between African American (AA) and European American (EA) colorectal
cancer patients. We evaluated effect modification by race for exposure and
patient-outcomes associations with colorectal tumor methylation among 218 AA and 
267 EA colorectal cancer cases from the population-based North Carolina Colon
Cancer Study. Tumor methylation was assessed in CACNA1G, MLH1, NEUROG1, RUNX3,
and SOCS1. We used logistic regression to assess whether associations between
several lifestyle factors-intake of fruits, vegetables, folate, and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs-and tumor methylation were modified by race. Proportional
hazards models were used to evaluate whether race modified associations between
tumor methylation and time to all-cause mortality. Greater fruit consumption was 
associated with greater odds of high NEUROG1 methylation among EA at methylation 
cut points of 15-35% (maximum OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.66, 7.13) but not among AA.
Higher folate intake was associated with lower odds of high CACNA1G methylation
among EAs but not AAs. Tumor methylation was not associated with all-cause
mortality for either group. Race might modify associations between lifestyle
factors and colorectal tumor methylation, but in this sample did not appear to
modify associations between tumor methylation and all-cause mortality.

Periodontal disease (PD) shares common risk factors with cardiovascular disease. 
Our hypothesis was that having a family history of myocardial infarction
(FamHxMI) may be a novel risk factor for PD. Risk assessment based on FamHxMI,
conditional on smoking status, was examined given the strong influence of smoking
on PD. Exploratory analysis with inflammatory biomarkers and genetic determinants
was conducted to understand potential mechanistic links. The Women's Genome
Health Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort of US female health care
professionals who provided blood samples at baseline in the Women's Health Study,
a 2 × 2 factorial clinical trial investigating vitamin E and aspirin in the
prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. PD was ascertained via
self-report over 12 y of follow-up. Prevalence (3,442 cases), incidence (1,365
cases), and survival analysis of PD were investigated for associations of FamHxMI
as well as in strata of FamHxMI by smoking. Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square tests,
multivariate regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the
analyses. In the WGHS, women with FamHxMI showed higher risk of ever having PD. A
particularly high-risk group of having both FamHxMI and smoking at baseline was
highlighted in the prevalence and risk of developing PD. PD risk increased
according to the following strata: no FamHxMI and nonsmokers (reference), FamHxMI
and nonsmokers (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.5), smokers without
FamHxMI (HR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.2 to 1.5), and smokers with FamHxMI (HR = 1.5, 95% 
CI = 1.2 to 1.8). An independent analysis by the dental Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities study ( N = 5,552) identified more severe periodontitis cases among
participants in the high-risk group (smokers with FamHxMI). Further examination
of interactions among inflammatory biomarkers or genetic exploration with FamHxMI
did not explain the risk increase of PD associated with FamHxMI in the WGHS.
Future efforts based on an integrative-omics approach may facilitate validation
of these findings and suggest a mechanistic link between PD and FamHxMI.

The optimal management of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer
remains under debate. We aimed to compare the long-term survival outcomes between
definitive chemoradiation (dCR) and chemoradiation plus surgery (CRS) in patients
with stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Using the National Cancer
Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry,
adults (≥ 18 years old) with diagnosis of AJCC 6th edition stage III EAC (T3/N1, 
T4/N0, and T4/N1) between 2004 and 2014 were included. A multivariable Cox
regression was used to assess the effect of dCR and CRS on mortality. Of the 2633
patients included, 1115 (42%) underwent Dcr, and 1518 (58%) underwent CRS. The
5-year survival rate was 13% for patients undergoing dCR and 27% for patients
undergoing CRS (p < 0.0001). Our observational data suggest that patients with
stage III EAC may benefit by the use of esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy.

Malignancy is accompanied by changes in the metabolism of both cells and the
organism1,2. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with wasting
of peripheral tissues, a metabolic syndrome that lowers quality of life and has
been proposed to decrease survival of patients with cancer3,4. Tissue wasting is 
a multifactorial disease and targeting specific circulating factors to reverse
this syndrome has been mostly ineffective in the clinic5,6. Here we show that
loss of both adipose and muscle tissue occurs early in the development of
pancreatic cancer. Using mouse models of PDAC, we show that tumour growth in the 
pancreas but not in other sites leads to adipose tissue wasting, suggesting that 
tumour growth within the pancreatic environment contributes to this wasting
phenotype. We find that decreased exocrine pancreatic function is a driver of
adipose tissue loss and that replacement of pancreatic enzymes attenuates
PDAC-associated wasting of peripheral tissues. Paradoxically, reversal of adipose
tissue loss impairs survival in mice with PDAC. When analysing patients with
PDAC, we find that depletion of adipose and skeletal muscle tissues at the time
of diagnosis is common, but is not associated with worse survival. Taken
together, these results provide an explanation for wasting of adipose tissue in
early PDAC and suggest that early loss of peripheral tissue associated with
pancreatic cancer may not impair survival.

Current strategies aimed to cure HIV infection are based on combined efforts to
reactivate the virus from latency and improve immune effector cell function to
clear infected cells. These strategies are primarily focused on CD8+ T cells and 
approaches are challenging due to insufficient HIV antigen production from
infected cells and poor HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. γδ T cells represent a unique 
subset of effector T cells that can traffic to tissues, and selectively target
cancer or virally infected cells without requiring MHC presentation. We analyzed 
whether γδ T cells represent a complementary/alternative immunotherapeutic
approach towards HIV cure strategies. γδ T cells from HIV-infected virologically 
suppressed donors were expanded with bisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM) and cells
were used in autologous cellular systems ex vivo. These cells (a) are potent
cytotoxic effectors able to efficiently inhibit HIV replication ex vivo, (b)
degranulate in the presence of autologous infected CD4+ T cells, and (c)
specifically clear latently infected cells after latency reversal with
vorinostat. This is the first proof of concept to our knowledge showing that γδ T
cells target and clear autologous HIV reservoirs upon latency reversal. Our
results open potentially new insights into the immunotherapeutic use of γδ T
cells for current interventions in HIV eradication strategies.

The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify clinical trials 
of MDS and AML that included patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments, and to
summarize the symptom and other health related quality of life (HRQOL) concepts
most frequently assessed and the PRO instruments that were used. Sixteen
manuscripts describing 14 distinct trials met all criteria (i.e., phase 2 or 3
clinical trial for MDS or AML which included PRO assessment) and were published
between 1996-2017. In trials evaluating anemia, PRO scores showed significant
improvement in relevant domains (e.g. fatigue, function) among patients
identified as responders. In trials evaluating the impact of anti-cancer
therapies, improvements the baseline to end of treatment were observed in
physical functioning and HRQOL, however the rates of missing data in many of the

BACKGROUND: Women with HIV face an increased risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)
acquisition and persistence, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive
cervical cancer. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of
different cervical cancer screening strategies among women with HIV in South
Africa.
METHODS: We modified a mathematical model of HPV infection and cervical disease
to reflect coinfection with HIV. The model was calibrated to epidemiologic data
from HIV-infected women in South Africa. Clinical and economic data were drawn
from in-country data sources. The model was used to project reductions in the
lifetime risk of cervical cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) of Pap and HPV DNA screening and management algorithms beginning at HIV
diagnosis, at 1-, 2-, or 3-year intervals. Strategies with an ICER below South
Africa's 2016 per capita gross domestic product (US$5270) were considered
"cost-effective."
RESULTS: HPV testing followed by treatment (test-and-treat) at 2-year intervals
was the most effective strategy that was also cost-effective, reducing lifetime
cancer risk by 56.6% with an ICER of US$3010 per year of life saved. Other
cost-effective strategies included Pap (referral threshold: HSIL+) at 1-, 2-, and
3-year intervals, and HPV test-and-treat at 3-year intervals. Pap (ASCUS+), HPV
testing with 16/18 genotyping, and HPV testing with Pap or visual triage of
HPV-positive women were less effective and more costly than alternatives.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering per capita gross domestic product as the benchmark for
cost-effectiveness, HPV test-and-treat is optimal in South Africa. At lower
cost-effectiveness benchmarks, Pap (HSIL+) would be optimal.

We describe two cases of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) treated with
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy who had dramatic improvement in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor burden with DAA therapy alone. Both patients
were diagnosed with HCC on screening magnetic resonance imaging shortly after
beginning DAA therapy. Both patients achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) 
with dramatic improvement in HCC tumor burden on follow-up imaging without HCC
treatment. Patients with multifocal or advanced HCC are infrequently treated with
antiviral therapy for HCV. As a result, these cases provide unique insight into
the ongoing debate regarding the impact of SVR on existing and recurrent HCC. We 
review the current literature regarding this debate, as well as the theory of
immunosurveillance. We postulate that DAA therapy activates CD8+ T cells to
induce a T-cell-mediated response and increased immunosurveillance to
virus-induced liver cancer.

The US Food and Drug Administration and the Critical Path Institute's
Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium convened a cosponsored workshop on the 
use of PRO measures to inform the assessment of safety and tolerability in cancer
clinical trials. A broad array of international stakeholders involved in oncology
drug development and PRO measurement science provided perspectives on the role of
PRO measures to provide complementary clinical data on the symptomatic side
effects of anticancer agents. Speakers and panelists explored the utility of
information derived from existing and emerging PRO measures, focusing on the PRO 
version of the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events. Panelists and speakers discussed potential ways to improve the
collection, analysis, and presentation of PRO data describing symptomatic adverse
events to support drug development and better inform regulatory and treatment
decisions. Workshop participants concluded the day with a discussion of possible 
approaches to the patient-reported assessment of an investigational drug's
overall side effect burden as a potential clinical trial end point. The Food and 
Drug Administration reiterated its commitment to collaborate with international
drug development stakeholders to identify rigorous methods to incorporate the
patient perspective into the development of cancer therapeutics.

Despite major advancements in cancer treatments, there are still many limitations
to therapy including off-target effects, drug resistance, and control of
cancer-related symptoms. There are opportunities for local drug delivery devices 
to intervene at various stages of cancer to provide curative and palliative
benefit. Iontophoretic devices that deliver drugs locally to a region of interest
have been adapted for the treatment of cancer. These devices have shown promise
in pre-clinical and clinical studies for retinoblastoma, skin, bladder, and
pancreatic cancers. Herein, we review iontophoretic devices used in the
management of cancer.

The aim of this study was to develop a new drug substance with low toxicity and
effective inhibitory activity against cisplatin-resistant oral cancer. The
naturally produced pterostilbene was selected as the lead compound for design and
synthesis of a series of bis(hydroxymethyl)propionate-based prodrugs. All
derivatives were screened for antiproliferative effects against the
cisplatin-resistant oral squamous (CAR) cell line and the results indicated that 
several compounds demonstrated superior inhibitory activity compared with
pterostilbene and resveratrol. Among them, the most promising compound, 12, was
evaluated for in vivo antitumor activity in a CAR xenograft nude mouse model.
Obvious antitumor activity was observed at the lowest oral dose (25 mg/kg/day).
Increasing the dose of 12 to 100 mg/kg/day reduced the tumor size to 22% of the
control group. Based on these findings as well as the extremely low toxicity seen
in the in vivo studies, we believe that compound 12 could serve as a new lead for
further development.

PURPOSE: To investigate the degree to which lung ventilation and gas exchange are
regionally correlated, using the emerging technology of hyperpolarized (HP)-129Xe
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hyperpolarized-129Xe MRI studies were performed on 17
institutional review board-approved human subjects, including 13 healthy
volunteers, 1 emphysema patient, and 3 non-small cell lung cancer patients imaged
before and approximately 11 weeks after radiation therapy (RT). Subjects inhaled 
1 L of HP-129Xe mixture, followed by the acquisition of interleaved ventilation
and gas exchange images, from which maps were obtained of the relative HP-129Xe
distribution in three states: (1) gaseous, in lung airspaces; (2) dissolved
interstitially, in alveolar barrier tissue; and (3) transferred to red blood
cells (RBCs), in the capillary vasculature. The relative spatial distributions of
HP-129Xe in airspaces (regional ventilation) and RBCs (regional gas transfer)
were compared. Further, we investigated the degree to which ventilation and RBC
transfer images identified similar functional regions of interest (ROIs) suitable
for functionally guided RT. For the RT patients, both ventilation and RBC
functional images were used to calculate differences in the lung dose-function
histogram and functional effective uniform dose.
RESULTS: The correlation of ventilation and RBC transfer was ρ = 0.39 ± 0.15 in
healthy volunteers. For the RT patients, this correlation was ρ = 0.53 ± 0.02
before treatment and ρ = 0.39 ± 0.07 after treatment; for the emphysema patient
it was ρ = 0.24. Comparing functional ROIs, ventilation and RBC transfer
demonstrated poor spatial agreement: Dice similarity coefficient = 0.50 ± 0.07
and 0.26 ± 0.12 for the highest-33%- and highest-10%-function ROIs in healthy
volunteers, and in RT patients (before treatment) these were 0.58 ± 0.04 and
0.40 ± 0.04. The average magnitude of the differences between RBC- and
ventilation-derived functional effective uniform dose, fV20Gy, fV10Gy, and fV5Gy 
were 1.5 ± 1.4 Gy, 4.1% ± 3.8%, 5.0% ± 3.8%, and 5.3% ± 3.9%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Ventilation may not be an effective surrogate for true regional lung 
function for all patients.

BACKGROUND: Regorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits angiogenesis,
growth, and proliferation, prolongs survival as monotherapy in patients with
refractory colorectal cancer. This international, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter trial assessed the efficacy of regorafenib with
folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as a second-line treatment
for metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who progressed on first-line 
oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidine enrolled at 45 sites in the United States and
Ireland. Patients, stratified by prior bevacizumab use, were randomized 2:1 to
regorafenib or placebo. The treatment consisted of FOLFIRI on days 1 and 2 and
days 15 and 16 with 160 mg of regorafenib or placebo on days 4 to 10 and days 18 
to 24 of every 28-day cycle. Crossover was not allowed. The primary endpoint was 
progression-free survival (PFS). Under the assumption of a 75% event rate, 180
patients were required for 135 events to achieve 90% power to detect a hazard
ratio (HR) of 0.65 with a 1-sided α value of .1.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one patients were randomized (120 to
regorafenib-FOLFIRI and 61 to placebo-FOLFIRI) with a median age of 62 years.
Among these, 117 (65%) received prior bevacizumab or aflibercept. PFS was longer 
with regorafenib-FOLFIRI than placebo-FOLFIRI (median, 6.1 vs 5.3 months; HR,
0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.01; log-rank P = .056). The median
overall survival was not longer (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.71-1.44). The response rate 
was higher with regorafenib-FOLFIRI (34%; 95% CI, 25%-44%) than placebo-FOLFIRI
(21%; 95% CI, 11%-33%; P = .07). Grade 3/4 adverse events with a >5% absolute
increase from regorafenib included diarrhea, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia,
hypophosphatemia, and hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of regorafenib to FOLFIRI as second-line therapy for
metastatic colorectal cancer only modestly prolonged PFS over FOLFIRI alone.

Clinically relevant subtypes exist for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
but molecular characterization is not yet standard in clinical care. We
implemented a biopsy protocol to perform time-sensitive whole-exome sequencing
and RNA sequencing for patients with advanced PDAC. Therapeutically relevant
genomic alterations were identified in 48% (34/71) and pathogenic/likely
pathogenic germline alterations in 18% (13/71) of patients. Overall, 30% (21/71) 
of enrolled patients experienced a change in clinical management as a result of
genomic data. Twenty-six patients had germline and/or somatic alterations in
DNA-damage repair genes, and 5 additional patients had mutational signatures of
homologous recombination deficiency but no identified causal genomic alteration. 
Two patients had oncogenic in-frame BRAF deletions, and we report the first
clinical evidence that this alteration confers sensitivity to MAPK pathway
inhibition. Moreover, we identified tumor/stroma gene expression signatures with 
clinical relevance. Collectively, these data demonstrate the feasibility and
value of real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC.Significance:
Molecular analyses of metastatic PDAC tumors are challenging due to the
heterogeneous cellular composition of biopsy specimens and rapid progression of
the disease. Using an integrated multidisciplinary biopsy program, we demonstrate
that real-time genomic characterization of advanced PDAC can identify clinically 
relevant alterations that inform management of this difficult disease. Cancer

Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination could prevent most
HPV-associated cancers, but few U.S. adolescents are vaccinated according to
guidelines. To inform efforts to counsel parents more effectively, we sought to
quantify their views on the best and worst reasons for guideline-consistent HPV
vaccination. We hypothesized that parents' views would differ according to their 
vaccination confidence.Methods: We developed a best-worst scaling experiment to
evaluate 11 reasons healthcare providers commonly give for HPV vaccination. The
instrument was administered in 2016 via a national online survey to 1,177 parents
of adolescents. Parents completed 11 choice tasks of 5 reasons each, indicating
the best and worst reason in each task. We used conditional logistic regression
to rank reasons for the sample overall and by vaccination confidence
(low/high).Results: Parents viewed cancer prevention as the best reason for HPV
vaccination (P < 0.001). Other commonly endorsed reasons were preventing a common
infection, having lasting benefits, or being a safe vaccine (all P < 0.001).
Reasons viewed as worst were: It is a scientific breakthrough; I got it for my
own child; and your child is due (all P < 0.001). Stratified analyses indicated
small differences in how often parents with low versus high vaccination
confidence endorsed messages (P < 0.001), but the two groups ranked reasons
similarly overall.Conclusions: Parents prioritized cancer prevention as the best 
reason for guideline-consistent HPV vaccination. Several other common reasons,
including having vaccinated one's own child, may warrant additional
testing.Impact: Providers should emphasize cancer prevention when discussing HPV 
vaccination, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
the President's Cancer Panel, and others. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev;

OBJECTIVES: The agreement between clinician- and patient-reported toxicities and 
their association with poor tolerance to therapy were assessed in an older
population receiving curative radiotherapy (RT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients ≥ 65 years old with newly-diagnosed head and neck
or lung cancer receiving curative RT ± chemotherapy were enrolled on a
prospective, observational study. Agreement between clinician (CTCAEv4.02) and
patient (PRO-CTCAE, EORTC QLQ-C30) report of toxicities were assessed at
baseline, during treatment, and post-treatment. The association of clinician- and
patient-reported symptoms with poor tolerance to therapy (defined as
hospitalization, >3-day treatment delay, change in treatment regimen, or death)
was assessed.
RESULTS: Among 45 patients, median age was 71, 60% had head and neck cancer, and 
47% received concurrent chemotherapy with RT. In comparing CTCAE vs PRO-CTCAE,
there was good agreement at baseline except for fatigue, anorexia, and pain,
where clinicians under-reported the severity. The discrepancy increased during
treatment with clinicians reporting lower severity in ≥50% of matched pairs for
4/10 symptoms assessed. At follow-up, clinicians under-reported severity in ≥50% 
of pairs for 7/10 symptoms. CTCAE vs EORTC QLQ-C30 mirrored these findings.
Patient-reported symptoms of nausea and dysphagia at 2 weeks and
clinician-observed symptoms of nausea and dysphagia at 4 weeks were associated
with poor tolerance to therapy.
CONCLUSION: Clinicians under-report toxicities during and after curative RT in
older patients with head and neck or lung cancer. Select toxicities reported by
patients early in treatment and clinicians later in treatment were associated
with poor tolerance to cancer therapy, providing valuable complementary
information.

OBJECTIVE: This study explored neoplasm risk with liraglutide versus placebo in
the LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of
Cardiovascular Outcome Results) cohort.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: LEADER (NCT01179048) was an international, phase 3b,
randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants aged ≥50 years with type
2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk were assigned 1:1 to receive liraglutide 
(≤1.8 mg daily; n = 4,668) or placebo (n = 4,672) in addition to standard care
and monitored for 3.5-5 years (median follow-up 3.8 years). The occurrence of
neoplasms was a prespecified, exploratory secondary end point. Post hoc analyses 
of the time to the first confirmed neoplasms were conducted using a Cox
regression model.
RESULTS: Neoplasm was confirmed in 10.1% of patients with liraglutide versus 9.0%
with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12 [95% CI 0.99; 1.28]). The HR (95% CI) for
liraglutide versus placebo was 1.06 (0.90; 1.25) for malignant neoplasms and 1.16
(0.93; 1.44) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasms
occurring <1 year or <2 years after randomization and analyses by sex provided
similar results. In our main analyses, the 95% CI for the HR included one for all
malignant neoplasms evaluated (including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) except
for prostate neoplasms, which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients.
CONCLUSIONS: LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk. Firm
conclusions cannot be made regarding numeric imbalances observed for individual
neoplasm types (e.g., pancreatic cancer) that occurred infrequently. LEADER data 
do, however, exclude a major increase in the risk of total malignant neoplasms
with liraglutide versus placebo. Additional studies are needed to assess
longer-term exposure.

Background: Although germline genetics influences breast cancer incidence,
published research only explains approximately half of the expected association. 
Moreover, the accuracy of prediction models remains low. For women who develop
breast cancer early, the genetic architecture is less established.Methods: To
identify loci associated with early-onset breast cancer, gene-based tests were
carried out using exome array data from 3,479 women with breast cancer diagnosed 
before age 50 and 973 age-matched controls. Replication was undertaken in a
population that developed breast cancer at all ages of onset.Results: Three gene 
regions were associated with breast cancer incidence: FGFR2 (P = 1.23 × 10-5;
replication P < 1.00 × 10-6), NEK10 (P = 3.57 × 10-4; replication P < 1.00 ×
10-6), and SIVA1 (P = 5.49 × 10-4; replication P < 1.00 × 10-6). Of the 151 gene 
regions reported in previous literature, 19 (12.5%) showed evidence of
association (P < 0.05) with the risk of early-onset breast cancer in the
early-onset population. To predict incidence, whole-genome prediction was
implemented on a subset of 3,076 participants who were additionally genotyped on 
a genome wide array. The whole-genome prediction outperformed a polygenic risk
score [AUC, 0.636; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.614-0.659 compared with 0.601;
95% CI, 0.578-0.623], and when combined with known epidemiologic risk factors,
the AUC rose to 0.662 (95% CI, 0.640-0.684).Conclusions: This research supports a
role for variation within FGFR2 and NEK10 in breast cancer incidence, and
suggests SIVA1 as a novel risk locus.Impact: This analysis supports a shared
genetic etiology between women with early- and late-onset breast cancer, and
suggests whole-genome data can improve risk assessment. Cancer Epidemiol

We studied 137 primary testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) using high-dimensional
assays of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic features. These
tumors exhibited high aneuploidy and a paucity of somatic mutations. Somatic
mutation of only three genes achieved significance-KIT, KRAS, and
NRAS-exclusively in samples with seminoma components. Integrated analyses
identified distinct molecular patterns that characterized the major recognized
histologic subtypes of TGCT: seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and
teratoma. Striking differences in global DNA methylation and microRNA expression 
between histology subtypes highlight a likely role of epigenomic processes in
determining histologic fates in TGCTs. We also identified a subset of pure
seminomas defined by KIT mutations, increased immune infiltration, globally
demethylated DNA, and decreased KRAS copy number. We report potential biomarkers 
for risk stratification, such as miRNA specifically expressed in teratoma, and
others with molecular diagnostic potential, such as CpH (CpA/CpC/CpT) methylation
identifying embryonal carcinomas.

PURPOSE: Imaging parameters from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (18F-FDG PET) before and after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for
anal canal cancer correlate with clinical outcomes. This prospective,
hypothesis-generating pilot study investigates the relationship between interim
PET imaging during CRT for anal canal cancer and clinical outcome.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 2012 to August 2015, 30 patients with anal canal
cancer were enrolled in a prospective clinical study of PET prior to and during
CRT after ∼30 Gy. PET parameters of the primary site included maximum
standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total
lesion glycolysis (TLG). MTV and TLG were calculated based on 40% SUVmax (MTV40, 
TLG40) or SUV 2.5 (MTV2.5, TLG2.5) thresholds for pretreatment and interim
images. Absolute and change in PET parameters were assessed for association with 
freedom from local and regional recurrence (FFLR) using single-predictor Cox
regression models. Local and regional recurrence were primary and nodal
(in-field) recurrences, respectively.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were eligible for analysis. Patients were excluded
with nonsquamous cell histology, recurrent anal cancer, and incomplete studies
due to treatment toxicity or patient choice. Median follow-up was 2.5 years.
Pretreatment MTV40 (HR 1.4 [95% CI 1.02-2.05]), interim MTV2.5 (1.4 [1.04-1.89]),
and interim TLG2.5 (1.1 [1.01-1.21]) were associated with FFLR.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective pilot study, interim PET parameters were
associated with FFLR. These results warrant further investigation assessing the
value of interim PET as a biomarker of response in the treatment of patients with
anal cancer.

"No pain, No gain" still true with immunotherapy: When the finger shows the moon,
look at the moon!

There is a rising evidence that the proverbial statement "No pain, No gain" first
coined at the light of pioneering clinical experiences with canonical
chemotherapy still holds true in the era of modern treatments of cancer. This
close relationship between the occurrence of specific drug-related toxicity and
treatment outcome has been confirmed since then with a large variety of
treatments, ranging from cytotoxics, hormonotherapy, targeted therapy and much
interestingly even with the latest immune checkpoint inhibitors. In the current
context of precision medicine, and along with the constant quest for identifying 
predictive biomarkers, close monitoring of treatment-related toxicities could
therefore be convenient to help predicting therapeutic response, but presents
several caveats. The purpose of this review is to briefly describe these
relationships across the different treatments, to comment on possible underlying 
mechanisms and to comment on possible strategies aiming at exploiting this
relationship while keeping the maximal safety ensured in patients with cancer. In
particular, this review will investigate on how drug exposure along with germinal
and somatic genetic issues does impact on the "No Pain, No Gain" aphorism, and
why the temptation to use treatment-related toxicities as a cheap and convenient 
way to predict clinical outcome or to adapt dosing should be resisted. We do
advocate instead for developing comprehensive genomic support along with
extensive biomathematical modeling to better customize dosing and shift towards a

Oral cancer is a common and aggressive cancer with high morbidity, mortality, and
recurrence rate globally. Early detection is of utmost importance for cancer
prevention and disease management. Currently, tissue biopsy remains the gold
standard for oral cancer diagnosis, but it is invasive, which may cause patient
discomfort. The application of traditional noninvasive methods-such as vital
staining, exfoliative cytology, and molecular imaging-is limited by insufficient 
sensitivity and specificity. Thus, there is an urgent need for exploring
noninvasive, highly sensitive, and specific diagnostic techniques. Nano detection
systems are known as new emerging noninvasive strategies that bring the detection
sensitivity of biomarkers to nano-scale. Moreover, compared to current imaging
contrast agents, nanoparticles are more biocompatible, easier to synthesize, and 
able to target specific surface molecules. Nanoparticles generate localized
surface plasmon resonances at near-infrared wavelengths, providing higher image
contrast and resolution. Therefore, using nano-based techniques can help
clinicians to detect and better monitor diseases during different phases of oral 
malignancy. Here, we review the progress of nanotechnology-based methods in oral 
cancer detection and diagnosis.

Several studies have suggested that neurotensin receptors (NTRs) and neurotensin 
(NT) greatly affect the growth and survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC). Developing NTR-targeted PET probes could therefore be important for the
management of a pancreatic cancer patient by providing key information on the NTR
expression profile noninvasively. Despite the initial success on the synthesis of
18F-labeled NT PET probes, the labeling procedure generally requires lengthy
steps including azeotropic drying of 18F. Using a straightforward chelation
method, here we report the simple preparation of aluminum-18F-NOTA-NT starting
from aqueous 18F. The cell binding test demonstrated that [19F]AlF-NOTA-NT
maintained high receptor-binding affinity to NTR1. This probe was then further
evaluated in NTR1 positive pancreatic tumor models (AsPC-1 and PANC-1). After the
administration of [18F]AlF-NOTA-NT, small animal PET studies showed a high
contrast between tumor and background in both models at 1 and 4 h time points. A 
blocking experiment was performed to demonstrate the receptor specificity: the
tumor uptake in AsPC1 without and with blocking agent was 1.0 ± 0.2 and 0.1 ±
0.0%ID/g, respectively, at 4 h post injection. In summary, a NTR specific PET
agent, [18F]AlF-NOTA-NT, was prepared through the simple chelation method. This
NTR-targeted PET probe may not only be used to detect NTR1 positive pancreatic
tumors (diagnosis), but also it may be fully integrated to NTR target therapy
leading to personalized medicine (theranostic).

Although great success has been obtained in the clinic, the current immune
checkpoint inhibitors still face two challenging problems: low response rate and 
immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Here we report the combination of
immunogenic chemotherapy and locally expressed PD-L1 trap fusion protein for
efficacious and safe cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate that oxaliplatin (OxP) 
boosts anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy against murine colorectal cancer. By design of a
PD-L1 trap and loading its coding plasmid DNA into a lipid-protamine-DNA
nanoparticle, PD-L1 trap is produced transiently and locally in the tumor
microenvironment, and synergizes with OxP for tumor inhibition. Significantly,
unlike the combination of OxP and anti-PD-L1 mAb, the combination of OxP and
PD-L1 trap does not induce obvious Th17 cells accumulation in the spleen,
indicating better tolerance and lower tendency to irAEs. The reports here may
highlight the potential of applying PD-L1 inhibitor, especially locally expressed
PD-L1 trap, in cancer therapy following OxP-based chemotherapy.

In a recent Cell Reports article, Li et al. report that obesity is associated
with altered fatty acid metabolism and DNA methylation in the colonic epithelium,
which precede a tumor-prone gene-expression profile. Interestingly,
obesity-associated methylation and transcriptome changes were reversed by weight 
loss, and the duration of weight loss correlated with the extent of restored gene
expression. These findings have implications that are encouraging for weight loss
and cancer prevention.

PURPOSE: Complex bladder and colorectal cancer surgeries are associated with
significant patient morbidity, yet few resources exist to prepare patients for
the high levels of distress and complications they may experience. After
ethnographic research to identify design challenges, we held a user-centered
design (UCD) workshop to begin to develop patient- and caregiver-centered
interventions to support preparation for and recovery after complex cancer
surgery.
METHODS: Concepts that emerged from brainstorming sessions were visually
represented on storyboards and rated. Highly scored concepts were further
developed in break-out prototyping sessions and then presented to the entire
group for review in person and during subsequent webinars. We collected workshop 
products (worksheets, prototypes, and recordings) for analysis to identify
opportunities for intervention. The workshop, held in late 2014, was attended by 
three colorectal/oncologic surgeons, three urologic surgeons, five ostomy nurses,
one quality improvement leader, three patients, one caregiver, and three
experienced UCD facilitators.
RESULTS: Three opportunity areas were identified: (1) enhanced patient education 
including tele-health and multi-media tools (available at hospitals/clinics or
online in any setting), (2) personalized discharge assessment and care planning, 
and (3) integrated symptom monitoring and educational interventions. Stakeholders
reached consensus that enhanced patient education was the most important
direction for subsequent intervention development.
CONCLUSIONS: We engaged diverse stakeholders in a participatory, UCD process and 
concluded that research and practice improvement should prioritize the
development of educational interventions in the pre-operative period to set the
groundwork for improving appropriate self-care during recovery from major
colorectal and bladder cancer surgeries.

The NF-κB pathway is a critical regulator of immune responses and is often
dysregulated in cancer. Two NF-κB pathways have been described to mediate these
responses, the canonical and the noncanonical. While understudied compared to the
canonical NF-κB pathway, noncanonical NF-κB and its components have been shown to
have effects, usually protumorigenic, in many different cancer types. Here, we
review noncanonical NF-κB pathways and discuss its important roles in promoting
cancer. We also discuss alternative NF-κB-independent functions of some the
components of noncanonical NF-κB signaling. Finally, we discuss important
crosstalk between canonical and noncanonical signaling, which blurs the two
pathways, indicating that understanding the full picture of NF-κB regulation is
critical to deciphering how this broad pathway promotes oncogenesis.

Importance: Although clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is well described in aging healthy
populations, few studies have addressed the practical clinical implications of
these alterations in solid-tumor sequencing.
Objective: To identify and quantify CH-related mutations in patients with solid
tumors using matched tumor-blood sequencing, and to establish the proportion that
would be misattributed to the tumor based on tumor-only sequencing (unmatched
analysis).
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of samples from 17 469 
patients with solid cancers who underwent prospective clinical sequencing of DNA 
isolated from tumor tissue and matched peripheral blood using the MSK-IMPACT
assay between January 2014 and August 2017.
Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified the presence of CH-related mutations in
each patient's blood leukocytes and quantified the fraction of DNA molecules
harboring the mutation in the corresponding matched tumor sample.
Results: The mean age of the 17 469 patients with cancer at sample collection was
59.2 years (range, 0.3-98.9 years); 53.6% were female. We identified 7608
CH-associated mutations in the blood of 4628 (26.5%) patients. A total of 1075
(14.1%) CH-associated mutations were also detectable in the matched tumor above
established thresholds for calling somatic mutations. Overall, 912 (5.2%)
patients would have had at least 1 CH-associated mutation erroneously called as
tumor derived in the absence of matched blood sequencing. A total of 1061 (98.7%)
of these mutations were absent from population scale databases of germline
polymorphisms and therefore would have been challenging to filter informatically.
Annotating variants with OncoKB classified 534 (49.7%) as oncogenic or likely
oncogenic.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study demonstrates how CH-derived mutations could
lead to erroneous reporting and treatment recommendations when tumor-only
sequencing is used.

Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that
governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct
polyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We
explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using
in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin
chains with the Lys63 (K63) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the
"DNA-interacting patch" (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr9,
Lys11, and Glu34 Upon DNA damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains 
to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with 
an Ile44 patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental
or cancer patient-derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA binding
capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain 
accumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair
and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results therefore 
highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in
binding to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair.

Purpose: Bevacizumab is a VEGF-specific angiogenesis inhibitor indicated as an
adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple cancers. Hypertension is
commonly observed during bevacizumab treatment, and high-grade toxicity can limit
therapy or lead to cardiovascular complications. The factors that contribute to
interindividual variability in blood pressure rise during bevacizumab treatment
are not well understood.Experimental Design: To identify genomic regions
associated with bevacizumab-induced hypertension risk, sequencing of candidate
genes and flanking regulatory regions was performed on 61 patients treated with
bevacizumab (19 cases developed early-onset grade 3 hypertension and 42 controls 
had no reported hypertension in the first six cycles of treatment). SNP-based
tests for common variant associations and gene-based tests for rare variant
associations were performed in 174 candidate genes.Results: Four common variants 
in independent linkage disequilibrium blocks between SLC29A1 and HSP90AB1 were
among the top associations. Validation in larger bevacizumab-treated cohorts
supported association between rs9381299 with early grade 3+ hypertension (P =
0.01; OR, 2.4) and systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg (P = 0.02; OR, 2.1).
rs834576 was associated with early grade 3+ hypertension in CALGB 40502 (P =
0.03; OR, 2.9). These SNP regions are enriched for regulatory elements that may
potentially increase gene expression. In vitro overexpression of SLC29A1 in human
endothelial cells disrupted adenosine signaling and reduced nitric oxide levels
that were further lowered upon bevacizumab exposure.Conclusions: The genomic
region between SLC29A1 and HSP90AB1 and its role in regulating adenosine
signaling are key targets for further investigation into the pathogenesis of
bevacizumab-induced hypertension. Clin Cancer Res; 24(19); 4734-44. ©2018 AACR.

Background: State laws about pharmacists providing human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccines vary considerably, limiting many pharmacists' ability to provide this
important cancer prevention service. We characterized physician and parent
support for pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination for adolescents who are past due 
for vaccination.Methods: In 2014 to 2015, we conducted two national U.S. surveys 
of 776 primary care physicians (PCPs) and 1,504 parents of adolescents.
Respondents indicated the extent to which they supported pharmacist-provided HPV 
vaccination for 13- to 17-year-olds who are past due. Respondents could endorse
the provision unconditionally, or only if certain conditions were met, such as
pharmacists receiving proper vaccination training. We used multivariable logistic
regression to assess correlates of support.Results: Most physicians (79%) and
parents (81%) endorsed pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination if pharmacists had
received proper vaccination training, reported vaccine doses to adolescents' PCP,
and referred adolescents to PCPs for other health services. Family medicine
physicians were more likely than pediatricians to support trained pharmacists
providing HPV vaccination [OR = 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.22].
Support was also higher among physicians who practiced in Western states (OR =
2.11; 95% CI, 1.30-3.40). Parents' odds of endorsing trained pharmacists
provision of HPV vaccine increased with higher overall satisfaction with their
pharmacy's services (OR = 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19), belief in pharmacists'
competence in vaccination practices (OR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70), and overall
vaccine confidence (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.48).Conclusions: To increase
support for HPV vaccination services, pharmacists should raise awareness about
their immunization training and standardize vaccination protocols that ensure
coordination with primary care.Impact: Stakeholders' feedback and buy-in is
important to help guide expansion of HPV vaccination in pharmacies. Cancer

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression and influence cancer.
Primary transcripts of miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are poorly annotated and little is
known about the role of germline variation in miRNA genes and breast cancer (BC).
We sought to identify germline miRNA variants associated with BC risk and tumor
subtype among African-American (AA) women.
METHODS: Under the African American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER)
Consortium, genotyping and imputed data from four studies on BC in AA women were 
combined into a final dataset containing 224,188 miRNA gene single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) for 8350 women: 3663 cases and 4687 controls. The primary
miRNA sequence was identified for 566 miRNA genes expressed in Encyclopedia of
DNA Elements (ENCODE) Tier 1 cell types and human pancreatic islets. Association 
analysis was conducted using logistic regression for BC status overall and by
tumor subtype.
RESULTS: A novel BC signal was localized to an 8.6-kb region of 17q25.3 by four
SNPs (rs9913477, rs1428882938, rs28585511, and rs7502931) and remained
statistically significant after multiple test correction (odds ratio (OR) = 1.44,
95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-1.65; p = 3.15 × 10-7; false discovery rate
(FDR) = 0.03). These SNPs reside in a genomic location that includes both the
predicted primary transcript of the noncoding miRNA gene MIR3065 and the first
intron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein
2 (BAIAP2). Furthermore, miRNA-associated SNPs on chromosomes 1p32.3, 5q32, and
3p25.1 were the strongest signals for hormone receptor, luminal versus
basal-like, and HER2 enrichment status, respectively. A second phase of
genotyping (1397 BC cases, 2418 controls) that included two SNPs in the 8.6-kb
region was used for validation and meta-analysis. While neither rs4969239 nor
rs9913477 was validated, when meta-analyzed with the original dataset their
association with BC remained directionally consistent (OR = 1.29, 95% CI =
1.16-1.44 (p = 4.18 × 10-6) and OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.17-1.51 (p = 1.6 × 10-5),
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Germline genetic variation indicates that MIR3065 may play an
important role in BC development and heterogeneity among AA women. Further
investigation to determine the potential functional effects of these SNPs is
warranted. This study contributes to our understanding of BC risk in AA women and
highlights the complexity in evaluating variation in gene-dense regions of the
human genome.

BACKGROUND: Cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality among HIV patients 
in the US due to extended life expectancy with access to effective antiretroviral
therapy. Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk factor for adverse
health outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear. The
objective of this study was to determine whether HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL six
months after starting therapy was associated with 10-year first cancer risk.
METHODS: We followed 7,515 HIV therapy initiators from a US-based multicenter
clinical cohort from 1998 to 2014. We used nonparametric multiple imputation to
account for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorized
viral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <20, 20-199,
200-999, and >999 copies/mL. We calculated estimates of the cumulative incidence 
of cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. Inverse
probability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control for
confounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively.
RESULTS: Crude 10-year first cancer risk in the study sample was 7.03% (95% CI:
6.08%, 7.98%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loads
between 200 and 999 copies/mL six months after ART initiation (10.7%). After
controlling for baseline confounders, 10-year first cancer risk was 6.90% (95%
CI: 5.69%, 8.12%), and was similar across viral load categories.
CONCLUSION: Overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete viral
suppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to HIV patients after
treatment initiation. As more HIV patients gain access to treatment in the
current "treat all" era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will be
observed more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study of 
the role of low-level HIV RNA on cancer development.

University, Atlanta, GA.

BACKGROUND: Respiratory exposure to silica is associated with the risk of death
owing to malignant and nonmalignant disease. 2.3 million US workers are exposed
to silica. Occupational exposure limits for silica are derived from a number of
lines of evidence, including observational studies. Observational studies may be 
subject to healthy worker survivor bias, which could result in underestimates of 
silica's impact on worker mortality and, in turn, bias risk estimates for
occupational exposure limits.
METHODS: Using data on 65,999 workers pooled across multiple industries, we
estimate the impacts of several hypothetical occupational exposure limits on
silica exposure on lung cancer and all-cause mortality. We use the parametric
g-formula, which can account for healthy worker survivor bias.
RESULTS: Assuming we could eliminate occupational exposure, we estimate that
there would be 20.7 fewer deaths per 1,000 workers in our pooled study by age 80 
(95% confidence interval = 14.5, 26.8), including 3.91 fewer deaths owing to lung
cancer (95% CI = 1.53, 6.30). Less restrictive interventions demonstrated smaller
but still substantial risk reductions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that occupational exposure limits for silica can
be further strengthened to reduce silica-associated mortality and illustrate how 
current risk analysis for occupational limits can be improved.

Purpose: In this era of precision-based medicine, for optimal patient care,
results reported from commercial next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays should
adequately reflect the burden of somatic mutations in the tumor being sequenced. 
Here, we sought to determine the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis leading to
possible misattribution of tumor mutation calls on unpaired Foundation Medicine
NGS assays.Experimental Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of
individuals undergoing NGS of solid tumors from two large cancer centers. We
identified and quantified mutations in genes known to be frequently altered in
clonal hematopoiesis (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, ATM, CHEK2, SF3B1, CBL, JAK2)
that were returned to physicians on clinical Foundation Medicine reports. For a
subset of patients, we explored the frequency of true clonal hematopoiesis by
comparing mutations on Foundation Medicine reports with matched blood
sequencing.Results: Mutations in genes that are frequently altered in clonal
hematopoiesis were identified in 65% (1,139/1,757) of patients undergoing NGS.
When excluding TP53, which is often mutated in solid tumors, these events were
still seen in 35% (619/1,757) of patients. Utilizing paired blood specimens, we
were able to confirm that 8% (18/226) of mutations reported in these genes were
true clonal hematopoiesis events. The majority of DNMT3A mutations (64%, 7/11)
and minority of TP53 mutations (4%, 2/50) were clonal hematopoiesis.Conclusions: 
Clonal hematopoiesis mutations are commonly reported on unpaired NGS testing. It 
is important to recognize clonal hematopoiesis as a possible cause of
misattribution of mutation origin when applying NGS findings to a patient's care.

Quality of Life in Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Survivors: A Systematic
Review.

Center (Drs Nielsen, Bryant, and Mayer), The University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill; and School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina (Dr
Smith).

BACKGROUND: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) represents approximately
75% of newly diagnosed patients with bladder cancer. Non-muscle-invasive bladder 
cancer survivors have unique chronic burdens including frequent recurrences,
repeated surveillance cystoscopies and treatments, and the highest lifetime
medical cost per person among all cancers.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to summarize studies assessing quality
of life (QOL) in NMIBC survivors.
METHODS: The literature from January 2005 to March 2017 found in PubMed, CINAHL, 
and PsycINFO databases was reviewed systematically. Inclusion criteria were as
follows: (1) research about NMIBC survivors, (2) outcomes included QOL, (3)
original research article published in peer-reviewed journals, and (4) published 
in English.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included: 14 quantitative studies and 1
mixed-methods study. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer survivors had
significantly lower QOL compared with the general population, especially in
fatigue, physical and role functioning, and mental health. Repeated transurethral
resections and intravesical treatments were associated with impaired physical
function and mental health. Most NMIBC survivors had concerns of urinary and
bowel problems and sexual function.
CONCLUSION: Despite a good prognosis, NMIBC and its treatment have a significant 
impact on QOL in survivors. The findings showed large burdens in NMIBC survivors 
and suggest that further research is needed to better understand potential
opportunities to improve QOL in this population.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology nurses are in the critical position for
assessing symptoms and concerns. Oncology nurses should pay special attention to 
NMIBC survivors who have unique symptoms and burden with the aim of improving
survivors' QOL.

Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment play a supportive role in tumor
growth, progression, and treatment resistance; therefore, these nonmalignant
cells are potential therapeutic targets. In this issue of the JCI, Szot et al.
devised a strategy to exploit the cell-surface marker TEM8 (also known as
ANTXR1), which is expressed by cancer-associated stromal cells, as a zip code to 
deliver an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) linked to the potent cancer-killing drug
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In preclinical tumor and experimental metastasis 
models of multiple cancer types, TEM8-ADC targeted TEM8-expressing
cancer-associated stromal cells, which processed and liberated membrane-permeable
MMAE and released this drug via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter.
Released MMAE killed cancer cells through a bystander mechanism that did minimal 
damage to the stromal cells themselves. P-gp-expressing tumor cells displayed
MMAE resistance, suggesting that P-gp expression status may identify patients who
might benefit the most from TEM8-ADC. This strategy, termed DAaRTS (drug
activation and release through stroma), represents an elegant example of how
selective expression of a cell-surface molecule on cancer-associated stroma can
be exploited to facilitate drug delivery and shrink solid tumors.

PURPOSE: The ongoing opioid epidemic has claimed more than a quarter million
Americans' lives over the past 15 years. The epidemic began with an escalation of
prescription opioid deaths and has now evolved to include secondary waves of
illicit heroin and fentanyl deaths, while the deaths due to prescription opioid
overdoses are still increasing. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) moved to limit opioid prescribing with the release of opioid
prescribing guidelines for chronic noncancer pain in March 2016. The guidelines
represent a logical and timely federal response to this growing crisis. However, 
CDC acknowledged that the evidence base linking opioid prescribing to opioid use 
disorders and overdose was grades 3 and 4.
METHODS: Motivated by the need to strengthen the evidence base, this review
details limitations of the opioid safety studies cited in the CDC guidelines with
a focus on methodological limitations related to internal and external validity.
RESULTS: Internal validity concerns were related to poor confounding control,
variable misclassification, selection bias, competing risks, and potential
competing interventions. External validity concerns arose from the use of limited
source populations, historical data (in a fast-changing epidemic), and issues
with handling of cancer and acute pain patients' data. We provide a nonexhaustive
list of 7 recommendations to address these limitations in future opioid safety
studies.
CONCLUSION: Strengthening the opioid safety evidence base will aid any future
revisions of the CDC guidelines and enhance their prevention impact.

BACKGROUND: The recurrence score based on the 21-gene breast cancer assay
predicts chemotherapy benefit if it is high and a low risk of recurrence in the
absence of chemotherapy if it is low; however, there is uncertainty about the
benefit of chemotherapy for most patients, who have a midrange score.
METHODS: We performed a prospective trial involving 10,273 women with
hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer. Of the 9719 eligible
patients with follow-up information, 6711 (69%) had a midrange recurrence score
of 11 to 25 and were randomly assigned to receive either chemoendocrine therapy
or endocrine therapy alone. The trial was designed to show noninferiority of
endocrine therapy alone for invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom
from invasive disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death).
RESULTS: Endocrine therapy was noninferior to chemoendocrine therapy in the
analysis of invasive disease-free survival (hazard ratio for invasive disease
recurrence, second primary cancer, or death [endocrine vs. chemoendocrine
therapy], 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.24; P=0.26). At 9 years, the
two treatment groups had similar rates of invasive disease-free survival (83.3%
in the endocrine-therapy group and 84.3% in the chemoendocrine-therapy group),
freedom from disease recurrence at a distant site (94.5% and 95.0%) or at a
distant or local-regional site (92.2% and 92.9%), and overall survival (93.9% and
93.8%). The chemotherapy benefit for invasive disease-free survival varied with
the combination of recurrence score and age (P=0.004), with some benefit of
chemotherapy found in women 50 years of age or younger with a recurrence score of
16 to 25.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemoendocrine therapy had similar
efficacy in women with hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative, axillary
node-negative breast cancer who had a midrange 21-gene recurrence score, although
some benefit of chemotherapy was found in some women 50 years of age or younger.

Defects in DNA polymerase Eta (Polη) cause the sunlight-sensitivity and skin
cancer-propensity disorder xeroderma pigmentosum variant. The extent to which
Polη function depends on the upstream E3 ubiquitin ligase Rad18 is controversial 
and has not been investigated using mouse models. Therefore, we tested the role
of Rad18 in UV-inducible skin tumorigenesis. Because Rad18 deficiency leads to
compensatory DNA damage signaling by Chk2, we also investigated genetic
interactions between Rad18 and Chk2 in vivo. Chk2-/-Rad18-/- mice were prone to
spontaneous lymphomagenesis. Both Chk2-/- and Chk2-/-Rad18-/- mice were prone to 
UV-B irradiation-induced skin tumorigenesis when compared with wild-type (WT)
animals, but unexpectedly Rad18-/- mice did not recapitulate the skin tumor
propensity of Polη mutants. UV-irradiated Rad18-/- cells were more susceptible to
G1/S arrest and apoptosis than WT cultures. Chk2 deficiency alleviated both
UV-induced G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis of WT and Rad18-/- cells, but led to
increased genomic instability. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the
tumor-suppressive role of Polη in UV-treated skin is Rad18 independent. We also
define a role for Chk2 in suppressing UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in vivo.
This study identifies Chk2 dysfunction as a potential risk factor for
sunlight-induced skin tumorigenesis in humans.

PURPOSE: Studies have associated increased radiation therapy (RT) heart dose with
cardiac toxicity. Others have correlated RT-related immunosuppression with
worsened survival. Given the large vascular volumes irradiated during locally
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) treatment, we hypothesized an
association between increased heart dose and immunosuppression.
METHODS: We identified 400 LA-NSCLC patients treated with definitive
RT ± chemotherapy between 2001 and 2016. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC),
absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio
(NLR = ANC/ALC) were analyzed pre-RT, during RT, and post-RT. Multivariable
analysis (MVA) was performed to correlate Clinical factors with both hematologic 
toxicity and overall survival. An upper tertile threshold to increase specificity
of NLR was chosen to dichotomize continuous hematologic variables.
RESULTS: Median follow up was 17 months (range 0.2-174 months) in all patients
and 46 months (range 0.2-161 months) in survivors. A total of 94% of patients had
stage III disease and 77% received concurrent chemo radiation. Two-year overall
survival (OS), freedom from local recurrence (FFLR), and freedom from distant
metastases (FFDM) was 42%, 60% and 45%, respectively. Median survival was
18 months. On MVA for OS (n = 207), male gender (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.7; 95% CI
1.2-2.3), RT alone (HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.9-4.0), the percentage of heart receiving
≥50 Gy (V50) (HR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.03), and higher NLR at 4 months (HR 1.02,
95% CI 1.01-1.03) were associated with reduced OS. ALC nadir was not associated
with treatment outcomes. NLR >10.5 was associated with decreased OS (p < 0.001)
and decreased FFDM (p = 0.04). On MVA evaluating factors associated with
hematological toxicity (n = 247), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 2.6; 95% CI 1.3-5.0; 
p = 0.006), RT alone (HR 3.6; 95% CI 1.1-12; p = 0.04), and heart V50 >25% (HR
2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.5; p = 0.02) were associated with a NLR >10.5 4 months post-RT.
CONCLUSION: RT related immunosuppression is associated with worse patient
outcomes, and may represent a source of increased mortality beyond cardiac
toxicity alone.

AIM: To estimate the healthcare utilization and costs in elderly lung cancer
patients with and without pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD).
METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data,
this study identified patients with lung cancer between 2006-2010, at least 66
years of age, and continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the 12
months prior to cancer diagnosis. The diagnosis of pre-existing COPD in lung
cancer patients was identified using ICD-9 codes. Healthcare utilization and
costs were categorized as inpatient hospitalizations, skilled nursing facility
(SNF) use, physician office visits, ER visits, and outpatient encounters for
every stage of lung cancer. The adjusted analysis was performed using a
generalized linear model for healthcare costs and a negative binomial model for
healthcare utilization.
RESULTS: Inpatient admissions in the COPD group increased for each stage of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to the non-COPD group per 100
person-months (Stage I: 14.67 vs 9.49 stays, p < .0001; Stage II: 14.13 vs 10.78 
stays, p < .0001; Stage III: 28.31 vs 18.91 stays, p < .0001; Stage IV: 49.5 vs
31.24 stays, p < .0001). A similar trend was observed for outpatient visits, with
an increase in utilization among the COPD group (Stage I: 1136.04 vs 796 visits, 
p < .0001; Stage II: 1325.12 vs 983.26 visits, p < .0001; Stage III: 2025.47 vs
1656.64 visits, p < .0001; Stage IV: 2825.73 vs 2422.26 visits, p < .0001). Total
direct costs per person-month in patients with pre-existing COPD were
significantly higher than the non-COPD group across all services ($54,799.16 vs
$41,862.91). Outpatient visits represented the largest cost category across all
services in both groups, with higher costs among the COPD group ($41,203 vs
$31,140.08).
CONCLUSION: Healthcare utilization and costs among lung cancer patients with
pre-existing COPD was ∼2-3-times higher than the non-COPD group.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to define the role of first-line platinum-based
doublet chemotherapy in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed three first-line NSCLC trials: CALGB 9730,
CALGB 30203, and CALGB 30801, which tested carboplatin and paclitaxel;
carboplatin and gemcitabine; and carboplatin with either pemetrexed or
gemcitabine, respectively. Overall survival was the primary endpoint. Age-based
comparisons with a cutpoint of 65 years were performed with Cox proportional
hazards models with adjustments for sex, tumor histology, cancer stage,
chemotherapy, and smoking history and after stratifying by performance score.
Secondary endpoints were grade 3-5 adverse events, chemotherapy cycles completed,
and whether toxicity prompted chemotherapy discontinuation.
RESULTS: 730 patients were included; 337 (46%) were 65+ years of age. No
statistically significant difference in survival was observed for older (≥65)
versus younger patients (HR = 1.096; 95% CI = (0.94, 1.28); p = 0.25). A trend
emerged with increased odds of a grade 3-5 adverse event for patients ≥65 years
versus <65 years (OR = 1.52; 95% CI = (0.99, 2.31); p = 0.05). The proportion of 
completed chemotherapy cycles was marginally lower in older patients
(difference = -5%; 95% CI = (-9, 0.2); p = 0.06) for those ≥65 years versus
<65 years, but no statistically significant difference occurred in the rate of
chemotherapy discontinuation for toxicity (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = (0.85, 2.19);
p = 0.21) for patients ≥65 years versus <65 years. A cutpoint of 70 years yielded
similar results.
CONCLUSION: These findings support carboplatin doublet-based chemotherapy in
select older patients with advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised about both over- and underutilization of
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in older patients and the need to align
screening behavior with likelihood of net benefit.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test a novel use of a patient
decision aid (PtDA) to promote appropriate CRC screening in older adults.
METHODS: A total of 424 patients ages 70 to 84 y who were not up to date with CRC
screening participated in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial of a PtDA 
targeted to older adults making decisions about whether to undergo CRC screening 
from March 2012 to February 2015.
INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to a targeted PtDA or an attention
control. The PtDA was designed to facilitate individualized decision
making-helping patients understand the potential risks, benefits, and
uncertainties of CRC screening given advanced age, health state, preferences, and
values.
OUTCOMES: Two composite outcomes, appropriate CRC screening behavior 6 mo after
the index visit and appropriate screening intent immediately after the visit,
were defined as completed screening or intent for patients in good health,
discussion about screening with their provider for patients in intermediate
health, and no screening or intent for patients in poor health. Health state was 
determined by age and Charlson Comorbidity Index.
RESULTS: Four hundred twelve (97%) and 421 (99%) patients were analyzed for the
primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Appropriate screening behavior at 6
mo was higher in the intervention group (55% v. 45%, P = 0.023) as was
appropriate screening intent following the provider visit (61% v. 47%, P =
0.003).
LIMITATIONS: The study took place in a single geographic region. The appropriate 
CRC screening classification system used in this study has not been formally
validated.
CONCLUSIONS: A PtDA for older adults promoted appropriate CRC screening behavior 
and intent.

Cooperativity between WNT and FGF signaling is well documented in embryonic
development and cancer progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this 
cross-talk remain elusive. In this study, we interrogated the dynamics of RNA
levels, ribosome occupancy, and protein expression as a function of inducible FGF
signaling in mouse mammary glands with constitutive WNT hyperactivation.
Multiomics correlation analysis revealed a substantial discrepancy between RNA
and ribosome occupancy levels versus protein levels. However, this discrepancy
decreased as cells became premalignant and dynamically responded to FGF
signaling, implicating the importance of stringent gene regulation in
nontransformed cells. Analysis of individual genes demonstrated that acute FGF
hyperactivation increased translation of many stem cell self-renewal regulators, 
including WNT signaling components, and decreased translation of genes regulating
cellular senescence. WNT pathway components translationally upregulated by FGF
signaling had long and structured 5' UTRs with a high frequency of polypurine
sequences, several of which harbored (CGG)4 motifs that can fold into either
stable G-quadruplexes or other stable secondary structures. The FGF-mediated
increase in translation of WNT pathway components was compromised by silvestrol, 
an inhibitor of EIF4A that clamps EIF4A to polypurine sequences to block 43S
scanning and inhibits its RNA-unwinding activity important for translation
initiation. Moreover, silvestrol treatment significantly delayed FGF-WNT-driven
tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF signaling
selectively enhances translation of structured mRNAs, particularly WNT signaling 
components, and highlight their vulnerability to inhibitors that target the RNA
helicase EIF4A.Significance: The RNA helicase EIF4A may serve as a therapeutic
target for breast cancers that require FGF and WNT signaling. Cancer Res; 78(15);

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical predictors related
to the risk of high-grade papillary bladder cancer before first-time
transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TUR-Bt), and to develop and validate 
a nomogram predicting the risk of high-grade papillary bladder cancer.
METHODS: A retrospective clinical study of consecutive patients who underwent
first-time TUR-Bt for papillary bladder cancer was performed. Medical records
were reviewed uniformly, and the following data were collected: age, sex,
episodes of urinary symptoms, tumor size, number of tumors, location of the
largest tumor (lateral walls, base, posterior wall, dome, and anterior wall),
tumor appearance (papillary or non-papillary, pedunculated or sessile), and
urinary cytology. Data from 254 patients (Group A) were used for the development 
of a nomogram, while data from 170 patients (Group B) were used for its external 
validation.
RESULTS: High-grade papillary bladder cancer was pathologically diagnosed in 51.6
and 74.6% of Group A and Group B patients, respectively. Based on univariable
analyses in Group A, macrohematuria, tumor size, multiple tumors, appearance, and
positive urinary cytology were selected as variables to incorporate into a
nomogram. The AUC value was 0.81 for the internal validation (Group A), and 0.78 
for the external validation (Group B). This novel nomogram can predict high-grade
papillary bladder cancer accurately.
CONCLUSIONS: The present nomogram can help clinicians calculate the probability
in patients with bladder cancer before TUR-Bt and decide on earlier intervention 
and priorities for the treatment of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopists who encounter an interval colorectal cancer
(I-CRC) may be concerned about the implications because I-CRCs may represent a
lapse in colonoscopy quality and a missed opportunity for prevention. We wanted
to determine the I-CRC rate per colonoscopy examination and to examine the effect
of colonoscopy volume and adenoma detection rate (ADR) on the number of I-CRCs
attributable to an endoscopist.
METHODS: We determined the rate of I-CRC diagnosis per outpatient colonoscopy
examination by measuring the incidence of CRC diagnosis in practice and by
assessing, via literature review, the percentage of cancers that are interval. We
also estimated the number of attributable I-CRCs as a function of ADR and
colonoscopy volume.
RESULTS: Among 93,562 colonoscopies performed in 2013 to 2015 by 120 physicians
in 4 diverse U.S. medical centers, 526 CRCs were diagnosed (.6%). Of 149,556 CRCs
in the published literature, 7958 were I-CRCs (5.25% ± .94%). With rates of .6%
(CRC per colonoscopy) and 5.25% (I-CRC per CRC), the rate of I-CRC is 1 per 3174 
colonoscopies (95% confidence interval, 1 per 2710 to 1 per 3875). An endoscopist
at the median of outpatient colonoscopy volume (316/year) in the lowest ADR
quintile of detection (7%-19%) would have an I-CRC attributed every 8.2 years, or
4.2 I-CRCs in a 35-year career, versus every 16.7 years, or 2.0 I-CRCs in a
35-year career, for an endoscopist in the highest ADR quintile (33%-52%).
CONCLUSIONS: An average-volume endoscopist will have 2 to 4 attributable I-CRCs
in a 35-year career, but the frequency will vary depending on colonoscopy volume 
and ADR.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed patient-centered communication (PCC) among newly
diagnosed colorectal cancer patients. PCC, a key part of patient-centered care,
contributes directly and indirectly to health-related quality of life,
satisfaction with care, and other outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients in North Carolina, using a
theoretically-based and validated measure that provides an overall PCC score and 
subscale scores for six PCC functions.
RESULTS: A total of 501 patients participated. The highest scores were for the
PCC functions of Fostering Healing Relationships, Exchanging Information, and
Making Decisions. The lowest scores were for the functions of Managing
Uncertainty and Enabling Self-Management, yet these were functions respondents
rated as most important. Respondents who thought about more than one health
professional (versus oncologist) reported better communication. PCC also varied
by treatment type, mental and physical health status, age, race, and education.
CONCLUSION: Most patients reported good communication overall, however patients
in poor physical health and mental health reported worse communication. The
quality of communication varied across the PCC functions.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals need to use a PCC approach that
builds trust, respects the patient, provides salient information that patients
can understand, provides emotional support, and facilitates the patient's
engagement in care.

Fourteen novel amino-quinoline-5,8-dione derivatives (6a-h and 7a-h) were
designed and synthesized by coupling different alkyl- or aryl-amino fragments at 
the C6- or C7-position of quinoline-5,8-dione. All target compounds showed
antiproliferative potency in the low micromolar range in both drug sensitive
HeLaS3 and multidrug resistant KB-vin cell lines. Compounds 6h, 6d, 7a, and 7d
exhibited more potent antiproliferative effects than the other compounds.
Especially, compounds 6d and 7d displayed NQO1-dependent cytotoxicity and
competitive NQO1 inhibitory effects in both drug sensitive HeLaS3 and multidrug
resistant KB-vin cell lines. Furthermore, compounds 6h, 6d, 7a, and 7d induced a 
dose-dependent lethal mitochondrial dysfunction in both drug sensitive HeLaS3 and
multidrug resistant KB-vin cells by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS) levels. Notably, compound 7d selectively inhibited cancer cells,
but not non-tumor liver cell proliferation in vitro, and significantly triggered 
HeLaS3 cell apoptosis by regulating apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved
caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that these novel C6-
or C7-substituted amino-quinoline-5,8-dione derivatives, such as 7d, could be
further developed in the future as potent and selective antitumor agents to
potentially circumvent multi-drug resistance (MDR).

Background: Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have an elevated risk for certain
types of cancer. With modern antiretroviral therapy, PLWH are aging and cancer
rates are changing.
Objective: To project cancer incidence rates and burden (number of new cancer
diagnoses) among adult PLWH in the United States through 2030.
Design: Descriptive.
Setting: HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study to project cancer rates and HIV Optimization
and Prevention Economics model to project HIV prevalence.
Participants: HIV-infected adults.
Measurements: Projected cancer rates and burden among HIV-infected adults in the 
United States by age during 2006 to 2030 for AIDS-defining cancer (ADC)-that is, 
Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer-and certain types of
non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC). All other cancer types were combined.
Results: The proportion of adult PLWH in the United States aged 65 years or older
is projected to increase from 8.5% in 2010 to 21.4% in 2030. Age-specific rates
are projected to decrease through 2030 across age groups for Kaposi sarcoma,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical cancer, lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and other
cancer types combined, and among those aged 65 years or older for colon cancer.
Prostate cancer rates are projected to increase. The estimated total cancer
burden in PLWH will decrease from 8150 cases in 2010 (2730 of ADC and 5420 of
NADC) to 6690 cases in 2030 (720 of ADC and 5980 of NADC). In 2030, prostate
cancer (n = 1590) and lung cancer (n = 1030) are projected to be the most common 
cancer types.
Limitation: Projections assume that current trends in cancer incidence rates, HIV
transmission, and survival will continue.
Conclusion: The cancer burden among PLWH is projected to shift, with prostate and
lung cancer expected to emerge as the most common types by 2030. Cancer will
remain an important comorbid condition, and expanded access to HIV therapies and 
cancer prevention, screening, and treatment is needed.

BACKGROUND: With total and out-of-pocket spending for oral oncolytics rising,
there is increased interest in choosing oncology treatments based on their
clinical value relative to cost.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if out-of-pocket spending varied for higher versus lower 
benefit oral oncology drugs reimbursed by commercial insurers.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of commercial insurer
prescription drug claims filed between 2007 and 2014 for 13 oral oncolytics
approved before 2009. We calculated mean monthly out-of-pocket payment for each
fill by patient. We then categorized oral oncolytics by their overall and
progression-free survival benefits for each FDA-approved indication, using
evidence from published studies. We assessed the relationship of survival benefit
with mean monthly out-of-pocket payment, adjusting for demographic and plan
characteristics.
RESULTS: Our population included 44,113 patients aged 18-65 years (mean 52.5 [SD 
9.4]) with a cancer diagnosis who filled 731,354 prescriptions. The most commonly
represented oncolytics were imatinib (37.4% of fills), lenalidomide (17.7% of
fills), and dasatinib (10.0% of fills). Approximately 32.3% of fills were for
drug-indication pairs with an overall survival benefit of 4+ years. In adjusted
analyses, there was no clear pattern to suggest that out-of-pocket payments
differed with drug indication-specific survival benefits. Drugs for indications
providing > 0 to 1 year of overall survival benefit were significantly more
likely to have a lower out-of-pocket payment versus those prescribed off-label,
but there were no significant differences in out-of-pocket payments between drugs
and associated indications in any other survival category versus drugs used
off-label.
CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-pocket payments for oral oncolytics were not clearly related 
to indication-specific value in commercially insured patients. This finding
suggests that despite increased attention to value- and indication-based drug
pricing, cost sharing for oral oncolytics does not currently reflect these goals.

BACKGROUND: Hearing and visual impairments are common among community-dwelling
older adults, and are associated with psychological, functional, and cognitive
deficits. However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding their
prevalence among older patients with cancer.
METHODS: The current study was a secondary analysis combining 2 prospective
cohorts of adults aged ≥65 years with solid tumors who were receiving
chemotherapy. The authors assessed the association between patient-reported
hearing and/or visual impairment (defined as fair/poor grading by self-report)
and physical function, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), anxiety, 
depression, and cognition. Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize
patient and treatment characteristics. One-way analysis of variance and
chi-square tests were conducted as appropriate to examine differences between
patients with and without sensory impairments. Logistic regression was used to
analyze associations between sensory impairments and outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 750 patients with a median age of 72 years who had solid tumors
(29% with breast/gynecological tumors, 28% with lung tumors, and 27% with
gastrointestinal tumors), approximately 18% reported hearing impairment alone,
11% reported visual impairment alone, and 7% reported dual sensory impairment.
Hearing impairment was associated with IADL dependence (odds ratio [OR], 1.9),
depression (OR, 1.6), and anxiety (OR, 1.6). Visual impairment was associated
with IADL dependence (OR, 1.9), poor physical function (OR, 1.9), and depression 
(OR, 2.5). Dual impairment was associated with IADL dependence (OR, 2.8), anxiety
(OR, 2.3), depression (OR, 2.5), and cognitive impairment (OR, 3.2).
CONCLUSIONS: Sensory impairment is common among older adults with cancer.
Patients with sensory impairment are more likely to have functional,
psychological, and cognitive deficits. Interventions aimed at improving the
vision and hearing of older adults with cancer should be studied. Cancer 2018. ©

BACKGROUND: Some, but not all, epidemiologic evidence supports a role for
cholesterol, the precursor for steroid hormone synthesis, in prostate cancer.
Using a PTEN-null transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer, we tested the effect
of modifying serum cholesterol levels on prostate tumor development and growth.
We hypothesized that serum cholesterol reduction would lower tumor androgens and 
slow prostate cancer growth.
METHODS: PTENloxP/loxP-Cre+ mice consuming ad libitum high fat, high cholesterol 
diets (40% fat, 1.25% cholesterol) were randomized after weaning to receive the
cholesterol uptake inhibitor, ezetimibe (30 mg/kg/day), or no intervention, and
sacrificed at 2, 3, or 4 months of age. Serum cholesterol and testosterone were
measured by ELISA and intraprostatic androgens by mass spectrometry. Prostate
histology was graded, and proliferation and apoptosis in tumor epithelium and
stroma was assessed by Ki67 and TUNEL, respectively.
RESULTS: Ezetimibe-treated mice had lower serum cholesterol at 4 months
(p = 0.031). Serum cholesterol was positively correlated with prostate weight
(p = 0.033) and tumor epithelial proliferation (p = 0.069), and negatively
correlated with tumor epithelial apoptosis (p = 0.004). Serum cholesterol was
unrelated to body weight (p = 0.195). Tumor stromal cell proliferation was
reduced in the ezetimibe group (p = 0.010). Increased serum cholesterol at 4
months was associated with elevated intraprostatic DHEA, testosterone, and
androstenedione (p = 0.043, p = 0.074, p = 0.031, respectively). However,
cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect adenocarcinoma development at 
2, 3, or 4 months of age (0, 78, and 100% in ezetimibe-treated vs. 0, 80, and
100% in mice not receiving ezetimibe).
CONCLUSIONS: Though serum cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect the 
rate of adenocarcinoma development in the PTEN-null transgenic mouse model of
prostate cancer, it lowered intraprostatic androgens and slowed tumor growth.
These findings support a role for serum cholesterol in promoting prostate cancer 
growth, potentially via enhanced tumor androgen signaling, and may provide new
insight into cholesterol-lowering interventions for prostate cancer treatment.

Inhibition of androgen biosynthesis is clinically effective for treating
androgen-responsive prostate cancer. Abiraterone is a clinical first-in-class
inhibitor of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1) required for androgen biosynthesis.
However, abiraterone also causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema, likely due
in part to off-target inhibition of another steroidogenic cytochrome P450,
CYP21A2. Abiraterone analogs were designed based on structural evidence that
B-ring substituents may favorably interact with polar residues in binding CYP17A1
and sterically clash with residues in the CYP21A2 active site. The best analogs
increased selectivity of CYP17A1 inhibition up to 84-fold compared with 6.6-fold 
for abiraterone. Cocrystallization with CYP17A1 validated the intended new
contacts with CYP17A1 active site residues. Docking these analogs into CYP21A2
identified steric clashes that likely underlie decreased binding and CYP21A2
inhibition. Overall, these analogs may offer a clinical advantage in the form of 
reduced side effects.

Although cancer immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors holds great
promise toward many types of cancers, several challenges still remain, associated
with low objective response of patient rate as well as systemic side effects.
Here, a combination immunotherapy strategy is developed based on a thermogelling 
reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polypeptide gel for sustained release of
anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 antibody and dextro-1-methyl tryptophan,
inhibitor of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase with leveraging the ROS level in the
tumor microenvironment. This bioresponsive gel depot can effectively reduce the
local ROS level and facilitate release of immunotherapeutics, which leads to
enhanced anti-melanoma efficacy in vivo.

PURPOSE: Annually, > 45,000 US women are diagnosed with cancer during adolescence
and young adulthood (AYA). Since 2006, national guidelines have recommended
fertility counseling for cancer patients. We examined childbirth after AYA cancer
by calendar period, cancer diagnosis, and maternal characteristics.
METHODS: We identified a cohort of women with an incident invasive AYA cancer
diagnosis at ages 15-39 during 2000-2013 in North Carolina. Cancer records were
linked with statewide birth certificates through 2014. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for first post-diagnosis live birth were calculated
using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: Among 17,564 AYA cancer survivors, 1989 had ≥ 1 birth after diagnosis
during 98,397 person-years. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence of live birth
after cancer was 10 and 15%, respectively. AYA survivors with a post-diagnosis
birth were younger at diagnosis, had lower stage disease, and had less often
received chemotherapy than those without a birth. The 5-year cumulative incidence
of post-diagnosis birth was 10.0% for women diagnosed during 2007-2012, compared 
to 9.4% during 2000-2005 (HR = 1.01; 0.91, 1.12), corresponding to periods before
and after publication of American Society of Clinical Oncology fertility
counseling guidelines in 2006.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in fertility preservation options and recognition
of fertility counseling as a part of high-quality cancer care, the incidence of
post-diagnosis childbirth has remained stable over the last 15 years.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Our study uses statewide data to provide
recent, population-based estimates of how often AYA women have biological
children after a cancer diagnosis.

High-grade urothelial cancer contains intrinsic molecular subtypes that exhibit
differences in underlying tumor biology and can be divided into luminal-like and 
basal-like subtypes. We describe here the first subtype-specific murine models of
bladder cancer and show that Upk3a-CreERT2; Trp53L/L; PtenL/L; Rosa26LSL-Luc
(UPPL, luminal-like) and BBN (basal-like) tumors are more faithful to human
bladder cancer than the widely used MB49 cells. Following engraftment into
immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, BBN tumors were more responsive to PD-1 inhibition 
than UPPL tumors. Responding tumors within the BBN model showed differences in
immune microenvironment composition, including increased ratios of CD8+:CD4+ and 
memory:regulatory T cells. Finally, we predicted and confirmed immunogenicity of 
tumor neoantigens in each model. These UPPL and BBN models will be a valuable
resource for future studies examining bladder cancer biology and
immunotherapy.Significance: This work establishes human-relevant mouse models of 
bladder cancer. Cancer Res; 78(14); 3954-68. ©2018 AACR.

BACKGROUND: With the development of increasingly effective antiemetic regimens,
guideline adherence can prevent 70%-80% of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting (CINV) in patients with cancer.
OBJECTIVES: This quality improvement project aims to increase rates of adherence 
to national guidelines and, ultimately, decrease rates of CINV experienced by
patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis was performed. In-person education was
provided to staff nurses and advanced practice providers on guidelines, followed 
by a survey immediately postintervention and again at three months.
FINDINGS: Prior to the intervention, 49% of patients were found to experience
CINV, with only 7% receiving guideline-appropriate prophylaxis. At three months, 
37% of patients experienced CINV, with 22% receiving appropriate prophylaxis.

Although annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for women 
at high risk for breast cancer as an adjunct to screening mammography, breast MRI
use remains low. We examined factors associated with breast MRI use in a cohort
of women with a family history of breast cancer but no personal cancer history.
Study participants came from the Sister Study cohort, a nationwide, prospective
study of women with at least 1 sister who had been diagnosed with breast cancer
but who themselves had not ever had breast cancer (n = 17 894). Participants were
surveyed on breast cancer beliefs, cancer worry, breast MRI use, provider
communication, and genetic counseling and testing. Logistic regression was used
to assess factors associated with having a breast MRI overall and for those at
high risk. Breast MRI was reported by 16.1% and was more common among younger
women and those with higher incomes. After adjustment for demographics, ever use 
of breast MRI was associated with actual and perceived risk. Odds ratios (OR)
were 12.29 (95% CI, 8.85-17.06), 2.48 (95% CI, 2.27-2.71), and 2.50 (95% CI,
2.09-2.99) for positive BRCA1/2 test, lifetime breast cancer risk ≥ 20%, and
being told by a health care provider of higher risk, respectively. Women who
believed they had much higher risk than others or had higher level of worry were 
twice as likely to have had breast MRI; OR = 2.23 (95% CI, 1.82-2.75) and
OR = 1.76 (95% CI, 1.52-2.04). Patterns were similar among women at high risk.
Breast cancer risk, provider communication, and personal beliefs were
determinants of breast MRI use. To support shared decisions about the use of
breast MRI, women could benefit from improved understanding of the chances of
getting breast cancer and increased quality of provider communications.

Local drug presentation made possible by drug-eluting depots has demonstrated
benefits in a vast array of diseases, including in cancer, microbial infection
and in wound healing. However, locally-eluting depots are single-use systems that
cannot be refilled or reused after implantation at inaccessible sites, limiting
their clinical utility. New strategies to noninvasively refill drug-eluting
depots could dramatically enhance their clinical use. In this report we present a
refillable hydrogel depot system based on bioorthogonal click chemistry. The
click-modified hydrogel depots capture prodrug refills from the blood and
subsequently release active drugs locally in a sustained manner. Capture of the
systemically-administered refills serves as an efficient and non-toxic method to 
repeatedly refill depots. Refillable depots in combination with prodrug refills
achieve sustained release at precancerous tumor sites to improve cancer therapy
while eliminating systemic side effects. The ability to target tissues without
enhanced permeability could allow the use of refillable depots in cancer and many
other medical applications.

Outcomes and Health Care Delivery.

Purpose Numerous organizations recommend that patients with cancer receive a
survivorship care plan (SCP) comprising a treatment summary and follow-up care
plans. Among current barriers to implementation are providers' concerns about the
strength of evidence that SCPs improve outcomes. This systematic review evaluates
whether delivery of SCPs has a positive impact on health outcomes and health care
delivery for cancer survivors. Methods Randomized and nonrandomized studies
evaluating patient-reported outcomes, health care use, and disease outcomes after
delivery of SCPs were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO,
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library.
Data extracted by independent raters were summarized on the basis of qualitative 
synthesis. Results Eleven nonrandomized and 13 randomized studies met inclusion
criteria. Variability was evident across studies in cancer types, SCP delivery
timing and method, SCP recipients and content, SCP-related counseling, and
outcomes assessed. Nonrandomized study findings yielded descriptive information
on satisfaction with care and reactions to SCPs. Randomized study findings were
generally negative for the most commonly assessed outcomes (ie, physical,
functional, and psychological well-being); findings were positive in single
studies for other outcomes, including amount of information received,
satisfaction with care, and physician implementation of recommended care.
Conclusion Existing research provides little evidence that SCPs improve health
outcomes and health care delivery. Possible explanations include heterogeneity in
study designs and the low likelihood that SCP delivery alone would influence
distal outcomes. Findings are limited but more positive for proximal outcomes
(eg, information received) and for care delivery, particularly when SCPs are
accompanied by counseling to prepare survivors for future clinical encounters.
Recommendations for future research include focusing to a greater extent on
evaluating ways to ensure SCP recommendations are subsequently acted on as part
of ongoing care.

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most common pediatric cancer in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), and also occurs frequently among adolescents and young adults (AYAs),
often associated with HIV. Treating BL in SSA poses particular challenges.
Although highly effective, high-intensity cytotoxic treatments used in
resource-rich settings are usually not feasible, and lower-intensity continuous
infusion approaches are impractical. In this article, based on evidence from the 
region, we review management strategies for SSA focused on diagnosis and use of
prephase and definitive treatment. Additionally, potentially better approaches
for risk stratification and individualized therapy are elaborated. Compared with 
historical very low-intensity approaches, the relative safety, feasibility, and
outcomes of regimens incorporating anthracyclines and/or high-dose systemic
methotrexate for this population are discussed, along with requirements to
administer such regimens safely. Finally, research priorities for BL in SSA are
outlined including novel therapies, to reduce the unacceptable gap in outcomes
for patients in SSA vs high-income countries (HICs). Sustained commitment to
incremental advances and innovation, as in cooperative pediatric oncology groups 
in HICs, is required to transform care and outcomes for BL in SSA through
international collaboration.

Background: Compared with Caucasian Americans (CAs), African Americans (AAs) with
colorectal cancer have poorer survival, especially younger-age patients. A robust
lymphocytic reaction within colorectal cancers is strongly associated with better
survival, but whether immune response impacts the disparity in colorectal cancer 
survival is unknown.Methods: The study population was comprised of 211
histologically confirmed colorectal cancers at the Medical University of South
Carolina (Charleston, SC; 159 CAs and 52 AAs) diagnosed between Jan 01, 2000, and
June 30, 2013. We constructed a lymphocyte score based on blinded pathologic
assessment of the four different types of lymphocytic reactions. Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to evaluate the association between the lymphocyte
score and risk of death by race.Results: Colorectal cancers in AAs (vs. CAs) had 
a stronger lymphocytic reaction at diagnosis. A high lymphocyte score (vs. the
lowest) was associated with better survival in AAs [HR 0.19; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.04-0.99] and CAs (HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.15-1.45). AAs with no
lymphocytic reaction (vs. other categories) had poor survival HR 4.48 (1.58-12.7)
whereas no difference was observed in CAs. The risk of death in AAs (vs. CA) was 
more pronounced in younger patients (HR 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22) compared with
older (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.54-2.67), especially those with lymphocytic poor
colorectal cancers.Conclusions: The lymphocytic reaction in tumor impacted the
racial disparity in survival.Impact: Our results confirm the importance of the
lymphocytic score on survival and highlight the need to fully characterize the
immune environment of colorectal cancers by race. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers

Gene expression profiling has had a considerable impact on our understanding
ofbreastcancer biology. Duringthelast decade, 4 intrinsic molecular subtypes of
breast cancer (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched [HER2-E] and Basal-like) have 
been identified and intensively studied. In this article, we review and discuss
the clinical implications of the 2 non-luminal subtypes (i.e. HER2-E and
Basal-like) identified within hormone receptor (HR)-positive disease. After
reviewing 32 studies for a total of 13,091 samples, ∼8% and ∼ 15% of early and
metastatic HR+/HER2-negative breast cancer, respectively, were found to be
non-luminal. Clinically, HR+/HER2-negative/non-luminal subtypes have been
associated with estrogen independence, chemo-sensitivity, resistance to CDK4/6
inhibition and poor outcome. Interestingly, EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibition 
might be of value in the HR+/HER2-negative/HER2-E subtype. Finally, the HER2-E
subtype within HR+/HER2 + disease represents ∼ 30% and has been associated with
anti-HER2 sensitivity, chemo-sensitivity and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. In 
the upcoming years, retrospective and prospective clinical trials evaluating both
biomarkers should lead to improvements in patient outcomes.

Randomized trials outside the U.S. have found non-inferior survival for
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) for
advanced ovarian cancer (AOC). However, these trials reported lower overall
survival and lower rates of optimal debulking than U.S. studies, leading to
questions about generalizability to U.S. practice, where aggressive debulking is 
more common. Consequently, comparative effectiveness in the U.S. remains
controversial. We reviewed U.S. comparative effectiveness studies of NACT versus 
PDS for AOC. Here we describe methodological challenges, compare results to
trials outside the U.S., and make suggestions for future research. We identified 
U.S. studies published in 2010 or later that evaluated the comparative
effectiveness of NACT versus PDS on survival in AOC through a PubMed search. Two 
independent reviewers abstracted data from eligible articles. Nine of 230
articles were eligible for review. Methodological challenges included unmeasured 
confounders, heterogeneous treatment effects, treatment variations over time, and
inconsistent measurement of treatment and survival. Whereas some limitations were
unavoidable, several limitations noted across studies were avoidable, including
conditioning on mediating factors and immortal time introduced by measuring
survival beginning from diagnosis. Without trials in the U.S., non-randomized
studies are an important source of evidence for the ideal treatment for AOC.
However, several methodological challenges exist when assessing the comparative
effectiveness of NACT versus PDS in a non-randomized setting. Future
observational studies must ensure that treatment is consistent throughout the
study period and that treatment groups are comparable. Rapidly-evolving oncology 
data networks may allow for identification of treatment intent and other
important confounders.

CONTEXT: Management of bladder cancer (BC) is primarily driven by stage, grade,
and biological potential. Knowledge of each is derived using clinical,
histopathological, and radiological investigations. This multimodal approach
reduces the risk of error from one particular test, but may present a staging
dilemma when results conflict. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)
may improve patient care through imaging of the bladder with better resolution of
the tissue planes than computed tomography and without radiation exposure.
OBJECTIVE: To define a standardized approach to imaging and reporting mpMRI for
BC, by developing a VI-RADS score.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We created VI-RADS (Vesical Imaging-Reporting And Data
System) through consensus using existing literature.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We describe standard imaging protocols and reporting criteria
(including size, location, multiplicity, and morphology) for bladder mpMRI. We
propose a five-point VI-RADS score, derived using T2-weighted MRI,
diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic contrast enhancement, which suggests the 
risks of muscle invasion. We include sample images used to understand VI-RADS.
CONCLUSIONS: We hope that VI-RADS will standardize reporting, facilitate
comparisons between patients, and in future years, will be tested and refined if 
necessary. While we do not advocate mpMRI for all patients with BC, this imaging 
may compliment pathology or reduce radiation-based imaging. Bladder mpMRI may be 
most useful in patients with non-muscle-invasive cancers, in expediting radical
treatment or for determining response to bladder-sparing approaches.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for bladder cancer are
becoming more common and may provide accurate information that helps improve
patient care. Here, we describe a standardized reporting criterion for bladder
MRI. This should improve communication between doctors and allow better
comparisons between patients.

PURPOSE: To identify clinical parameters that are prognostic for improved overall
survival (OS) after yttrium-90 radioembolization (RE) in patients with liver
metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 131 patients who underwent RE for liver
metastases from CRC, treated at 2 academic centers, were reviewed. Twenty-one
baseline pretreatment clinical factors were analyzed in relation to OS by the
Kaplan-Meier method along with log-rank tests and univariate and multivariate Cox
regression analyses.
RESULTS: The median OS from first RE procedure was 10.7 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 9.4-12.7 months). Several pretreatment factors, including lower
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; ≤20 ng/mL), lower aspartate transaminase (AST; ≤40
IU/L), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) <5, and absence of extrahepatic disease 
at baseline were associated with significantly improved OS after RE, compared
with high CEA (>20 ng/mL), high AST (>40 IU/L), NLR ≥5, and extrahepatic
metastases (P values of <.001, <.001, .0001, and .04, respectively). On
multivariate analysis, higher CEA, higher AST, NLR ≥5, extrahepatic disease, and 
larger volume of liver metastases remained independently associated with risk of 
death (hazard ratios of 1.63, 2.06, 2.22, 1.48, and 1.02, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of patients with metastases from CRC is impacted by a 
complex set of clinical parameters. This analysis of pretreatment factors
identified lower AST, lower CEA, lower NLR, and lower tumor burden (intra- or
extrahepatic) to be independently associated with higher survival after hepatic
RE. Optimal selection of patients with CRC liver metastases may improve survival 
rates after administration of yttrium-90.

OBJECTIVES: Depth of invasion was added to the eighth edition American Joint
Committee on Cancer guidelines for T staging of HPV-negative oral cavity squamous
cell carcinoma. Our aim was to determine the impact of depth of invasion on
pathological variables and outcomes in low-stage tongue cancer patients. We also 
examine the impact of tumor thickness and tumor clinical staging for comparison.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All clinical T1/T2 N0 HPV-negative tongue squamous cell
carcinoma patients who received elective neck dissections at our institution
between 2000 and 2015 were included. Logistic regression models and Cox
proportional hazard models were used to examine pathological variables,
recurrence, and 3-year disease-free survival.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients met criteria; the mean age was 52.0 (SD: 17.7).
Depth of invasion was a significant predictor of occult metastasis (OR: 2.0,
p = 0.05) and lymphovascular invasion (OR: 4.1, p = 0.02), and tumor thickness
was a significant predictor of lymphovascular invasion (OR: 3.3, p = 0.04). None 
of the variables were predictive of recurrence or disease-free survival.
CONCLUSION: Depth of invasion at biopsy may be a potential useful metric to
inform on regional management selection in this radiographic node-negative
population.

Continuous exposure of a pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 (MiaS) to
gemcitabine resulted in the formation of a gemcitabine-resistant subline (MiaR). 
In an effort to discover kinase inhibitors that inhibited MiaR growth, MiaR cells
were exposed to kinase inhibitors (PKIS-1 library) in a 384-well screening
format. Three compounds (UNC10112721A, UNC10112652A, and UNC10112793A) were
identified that inhibited the growth of MiaR cells by more than 50% (at 50 nM).
Two compounds (UNC10112721A and UNC10112652A) were classified as cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitors, whereas UNC10112793A was reported to be a PLK inhibitor.
Dose-response experiments supported the efficacy of these compounds to inhibit
growth and increase apoptosis in 2D cultures of these cells. However, only
UNC10112721A significantly inhibited the growth of 3D spheroids composed of MiaR 
cells and GFP-tagged cancer-associated fibroblasts. Multiplexed inhibitor bead
(MIB)-mass spectrometry (MS) kinome competition experiments identified CDK9,
CLK1-4, DYRK1A, and CSNK1 as major kinase targets for UNC10112721A in MiaR cells.
Another CDK9 inhibitor (CDK-IN-2) replicated the growth inhibitory effects of
UNC10112721A, whereas inhibitors against the CLK, DYRK, or CSNK1 kinases had no
effect. In summary, these studies describe a coordinated approach to discover
novel kinase inhibitors, evaluate their efficacy in 3D models, and define their
specificity against the kinome.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have examined long-term outcomes after childhood cancer,
but few address outcomes for adolescent and young adult (AYA; those aged 15-39
years) cancer survivors. Conditional survival reflects changing mortality risk
with time since cancer diagnosis and is a useful measure for planning long-term
follow-up care.
METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry 9
database, the authors identified a cohort of AYA patients diagnosed with a first 
malignant cancer between 1973 and 2009 and followed through 2014. They estimated 
5-year relative survival at the time of diagnosis and at each additional year
survived up to 25 years after diagnosis, conditional on the individual being
alive at the beginning of that year.
RESULTS: A total of 205,954 AYA patients with cancer were identified. Thyroid
cancer, melanoma, testicular cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and
central nervous system (CNS) tumors comprised 67% of all cancers. For all cancers
combined, 5-year relative survival was 84.5% (95% confidence interval,
84.3%-84.7%) at 1 year after diagnosis and 94.0% (95% CI, 93.9%-94.2%) at 5
years. The relative survival first exceeded 95%, reflecting minimal excess
mortality compared with the general population, at 7 years. Patients with thyroid
cancer, testicular cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer reached a relative
survival of >95% at the time of diagnosis and at 1, 3, and 18 years after
diagnosis, respectively. Estimates for those with Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia
were >95% at 6 and 13 years, respectively, but declined to <95% at 20 years. AYA 
individuals with CNS tumors did not reach 95% by 25 years after diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: For AYA survivors of breast cancer, CNS tumors, and hematologic
malignancies, long-term excess mortality should be considered when planning
follow-up care. Cancer 2018;124:3037-43. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

Purpose Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is a
standard of care for the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
Dose-dense cisplatin-based regimens have yielded favorable outcomes compared with
standard-dose chemotherapy, yet the optimal neoadjuvant regimen remains
undefined. We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of six cycles of neoadjuvant
dose-dense gemcitabine and cisplatin (ddGC) in patients with MIBC. Patients and
Methods In this prospective, multicenter phase II study, patients received ddGC
(gemcitabine 2,500 mg/m2 on day 1 and cisplatin 35 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2) every 2
weeks for 6 cycles followed by RC. The primary end point was pathologic
downstaging to non-muscle-invasive disease (< pT2N0). Patients who did not
undergo RC were deemed nonresponders. Pretreatment tumors underwent
next-generation sequencing to identify predictors of chemosensitivity. Results
Forty-nine patients were enrolled from three institutions. The primary end point 
was met, with 57% of 46 evaluable patients downstaged to < pT2N0. Pathologic
response correlated with improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival. 
Nineteen patients (39%) required toxicity-related dose modifications. Sixty-seven
percent of patients completed all six planned cycles. No patient failed to
undergo RC as a result of chemotherapy-associated toxicities. The most frequent
treatment-related toxicity was anemia (12%; grade 3). The presence of a presumed 
deleterious DNA damage response (DDR) gene alteration was associated with
chemosensitivity (positive predictive value for < pT2N0 [89%]). No patient with a
deleterious DDR gene alteration has experienced recurrence at a median follow-up 
of 2 years. Conclusion Six cycles of ddGC is an active, well-tolerated
neoadjuvant regimen for the treatment of patients with MIBC. The presence of a
putative deleterious DDR gene alteration in pretreatment tumor tissue strongly
predicted for chemosensitivity, durable response, and superior long-term
survival.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and
efficacy of induction chemotherapy, surgery, and pathology-guided adjuvant
therapy to treat transorally resectable squamous head and neck cancer.
METHODS: Patients had squamous head and neck cancer that was resectable by the
transoral route and advanced-stage disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer
stage III-IV, T3-T4 tumors, and/or positive lymph nodes). They received treatment
with weekly carboplatin at an area under the curve of 2, plus paclitaxel
135 mg/m2 , and daily lapatinib 1000mg for 6 weeks followed by surgical
resection. Pathology that revealed margins <5 mm, extracapsular extension, N2a of
N2b lymph node status, perineural invasion, or lymphovascular space invasion
resulted in adjuvant radiotherapy concurrent with weekly cisplatin. Pathology
with N2c/N3 lymph node status or positive margins resulted in radiation with
bolus cisplatin. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate to induction
chemotherapy, and a key secondary endpoint was feasibility.
RESULTS: Toxicity was modest, and 37 of 40 patients completed study procedures as
planned. The clinical response rate was 93%, the pathologic complete response
rate was 36%, and the clinical response did not predict for a pathologic complete
response. No patient on study follow-up has recurred or died. Twenty-nine of 39
patients who underwent surgery avoided radiation. Speech and swallowing function 
were well preserved.
CONCLUSIONS: The study met both its primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary
feasibility endpoint. Neoadjuvant, systemic therapy and surgical resection
followed by risk-adapted adjuvant therapy resulted in high response rates and
excellent long-term outcomes and should be further studied. Cancer

Gene therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in many genetic diseases, as
evidenced by recent clinical applications. Viral vectors have been extensively
tested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationic
polymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfection
efficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easily
tailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drive
great efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asks
if nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can find
application niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{
N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride} 
(PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side with
chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed by
intracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicity 
and fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA
(PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to make
serum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In an
intraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervical
cancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumor
inhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gave
much less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapy
drugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed much
fewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviral 
vectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantages
and may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example,
intraperitoneal cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Improving the health of black and minority ethnic (BME) men in the US
continues to be a public health priority. Compared with men of other races and
ethnicities, African-American men have higher rates of mortality and morbidity
from chronic illness and diseases including cancer, heart disease, prostate
cancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. One way to address these disparities is to include
African-American men in health research, to elicit their perspectives on health
risks and protective factors. These can then inform interventions aimed at
reducing health disparities. However, challenges remain in recruiting and
engaging African-American men in health research.
AIM: To provide strategies for recruiting African-American men in health
research, using as an exemplar a qualitative study of fathers' perspectives of
sexual health promotion with young African-American males.
DISCUSSION: Efforts are needed to increase the representation of African-American
men in health research. Ensuring that researchers are aware of the cultural,
social and environmental factors related to decisions to participate in research 
can lead to effective methods to recruit and engage them.
CONCLUSION: There are several essential strategies for increasing
African-American men's participation in health research: ensuring the research
team is culturally and gender-sensitive; recruiting in trusted environments;
using respected gatekeepers; developing trust with participants; and being
transparent.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Implementing strategies to include African-American
men in health research has the potential to improve health disparities in the US.

Widespread resistance to antimicrobial and cancer therapeutics is evolving in
every country worldwide and has a direct impact on global health, agriculture and
the economy. The specificity and selectivity of bioactive peptide natural
products present a possible stopgap measure to address the ongoing deficit of new
therapeutic compounds. PepSAVI-MS (Statistically-guided bioActive Peptides
prioritized VIa Mass Spectrometry) is an adaptable method for the analysis of
natural product libraries to rapidly identify bioactive peptides. This pipeline
was validated via screening of the cyclotide-rich botanical species Viola odorata
and identification of the known antimicrobial and anticancer cyclotide
cycloviolacin O2. Herein we present and validate novel bioactivities of the
anthelmintic V. odorata cyclotide, cycloviolacin O8 (cyO8), including micromolar 
anticancer activity against PC-3 prostate, MDA-MB-231 breast, and OVCAR-3 ovarian
cancer cell lines and antifungal activity against the agricultural pathogen
Fusarium graminearum. A reduction/alkylation strategy in tandem with PepSAVI-MS
analysis also revealed several previously uncharacterized putatively bioactive
cyclotides. Downstream implementation of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD)
tandem mass spectrometry is demonstrated for cyO8 as a method to address
traditionally difficult-to-sequence cyclotide species. This work emphasizes the
therapeutic and agricultural potential of natural product bioactive peptides and 
the necessity of developing robust analytical tools to deconvolute nature's
complexity.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a gammaherpesvirus that is the 
etiological agent of the endothelial cell cancer Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and 2 B
cell lymphoproliferative disorders, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and
multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). KSHV ORF36, also known as viral protein
kinase (vPK), is a viral serine/threonine kinase. We previously reported that
KSHV vPK enhances cell proliferation and mimics cellular S6 kinase to
phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6, a protein involved in protein synthesis. We
created a mouse model to analyze the function of vPK in vivo. We believe this is 
the first mouse tumor model of a viral kinase encoded by a pathogenic human
virus. We observed increased B cell activation in the vPK transgenic mice
compared with normal mice. We also found that, over time, vPK transgenic mice
developed a B cell hyperproliferative disorder and/or a high-grade B cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma at a greatly increased incidence compared with littermate
controls. This mouse model shows that a viral protein kinase is capable of
promoting B cell activation and proliferation as well as augmenting
lymphomagenesis in vivo and may therefore contribute to the development of viral 
cancers.

Treating Tobacco Use in Patients with Incurable Malignancies: Should We Even
Start the Conversation?

BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend that all medical providers
address tobacco use with patients, as the long-term health benefits of becoming
tobacco free are well documented. What happens, though, when a patient has an
incurable malignancy and, therefore, will not reap the long-term benefits?
Clinical Consideration: Our case study encourages providers to consider the
relevance of tobacco use treatment for those with incurable diseases.
DISCUSSION: Although long-term benefits will not provide realistic motivation,
other equally important rewards (e.g., decreased shortness of breath), a sense of
accomplishment shared by patients and family, and the ability to exert control
over a behavior can be equally motivating for some patients.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death among women of parenting age in
the United States. Women living with advanced or incurable cancer who have
dependent children experience high rates of depression and anxiety as well as
unique parenting challenges. To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have 
examined the parenting factors associated with health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) in women with advanced cancer.
METHODS: The authors conducted a cross-sectional, Web-based survey of the
psychosocial concerns of 224 women with a tumor-node-metastasis staging system of
the AJCC stage IV solid tumor malignancy who had at least 1 child aged <18 years.
Participants completed validated measures of HRQOL (Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]); depression and anxiety symptom severity;
functional status; parenting concerns; and investigator-designed questions to
assess demographic, communication, and parenting characteristics. Multiple linear
regression models were estimated to identify factors associated with FACT-G total
and subscale scores.
RESULTS: The mean FACT-G score was 66 (standard deviation, 16). The mean
Emotional Well-Being subscale scores were particularly low (13; standard
deviation, 5). In multivariable linear regression models, parenting variables
explained nearly 40% of the HRQOL model variance. In the fully adjusted model,
parenting concerns and the absence of parental prognostic communication with
children both were found to be significantly associated with HRQOL scores. For
each 1-point increase in parenting concern severity, FACT-G scores decreased by 4
points (P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: Women with metastatic cancer who are parents of dependent children
are at risk of high psychological distress and low HRQOL. Parenting factors may
have a negative influence on HRQOL in this patient population. Cancer

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered research requires the meaningful involvement of
patients and caregivers throughout the research process. The objective of this
study was to create a process for sustainable engagement for research
prioritization within oncology.
METHODS: From December 2014 to 2016, a network of engaged patients for research
prioritization was created in partnership with the Bladder Cancer Advocacy
Network (BCAN): the BCAN Patient Survey Network (PSN). The PSN leveraged an
online bladder cancer community with additional recruitment through print
advertisements and social media campaigns. Prioritized research questions were
developed through a modified Delphi process and were iterated through
multidisciplinary working groups and a repeat survey.
RESULTS: In year 1 of the PSN, 354 patients and caregivers responded to the
research prioritization survey; the number of responses increased to 1034 in year
2. The majority of respondents had non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),
and the mean time since diagnosis was 5 years. Stakeholder-identified questions
for noninvasive, invasive, and metastatic disease were prioritized by the PSN.
Free-text questions were sorted with thematic mapping. Several questions
submitted by respondents were among the prioritized research questions. A final
prioritized list of research questions was disseminated to various funding
agencies, and a highly ranked NMIBC research question was included as a priority 
area in the 2017 Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute announcement of
pragmatic trial funding.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement is needed to identify high-priority research
questions in oncology. The BCAN PSN provides a successful example of an
engagement infrastructure for annual research prioritization in bladder cancer.
The creation of an engagement network sets the groundwork for additional phases
of engagement, including design, conduct, and dissemination. Cancer 2018. © 2018

Loss of the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p) occurs early in >95% of clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Nearly ubiquitous 3p loss in ccRCC suggests
haploinsufficiency for 3p tumor suppressors as early drivers of tumorigenesis. We
previously reported methyltransferase SETD2, which trimethylates H3 histones on
lysine 36 (H3K36me3) and is located in the 3p deletion, to also trimethylate
microtubules on lysine 40 (αTubK40me3) during mitosis, with αTubK40me3 required
for genomic stability. We now show that monoallelic, Setd2-deficient cells
retaining H3K36me3, but not αTubK40me3, exhibit a dramatic increase in mitotic
defects and micronuclei count, with increased viability compared with biallelic
loss. In SETD2-inactivated human kidney cells, rescue with a pathogenic SETD2
mutant deficient for microtubule (αTubK40me3), but not histone (H3K36me3)
methylation, replicated this phenotype. Genomic instability (micronuclei) was
also a hallmark of patient-derived cells from ccRCC. These data show that the
SETD2 tumor suppressor displays a haploinsufficiency phenotype disproportionately
impacting microtubule methylation and serves as an early driver of genomic
instability.Significance: Loss of a single allele of a chromatin modifier plays a
role in promoting oncogenesis, underscoring the growing relevance of tumor
suppressor haploinsufficiency in tumorigenesis. Cancer Res; 78(12); 3135-46.

BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to estimate the rate of
local/regional failure (LRF) after definitive surgical intervention for
early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without postoperative
radiotherapy, in the era of contemporary imaging and minimally invasive surgical 
techniques.
METHODS: Medical records of patients with early-stage NSCLC (pathologic T1-4,
N0-1) who underwent lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy,
with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, between 2007 and 2015, were
retrospectively reviewed. LRF was defined as recurrence at the ipsilateral lung, 
bronchial stump, mediastinum, chest wall, or supraclavicular region. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to LRF, with patients censored at
death, and log-rank tests were used for comparisons. A two-sided p value of less 
than 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Included were 217 patients (median age, 65 years). Preoperative staging 
with positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed in 89% of
patients, mediastinoscopy was performed in 42%, and video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery was performed in 51%. At a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 1 to 120
months), the 5-year estimated LRF was 26% (95% confidence interval, 20% to 35%). 
LRF rates were not significantly different in those with and without staging
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (hazard ratio, 1.52; p = 0.43)
and those with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy
(hazard ratio, 1.00; p = 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite contemporary staging procedures and surgical techniques for 
early-stage NSCLC, LRF occurs in approximately 1 of 4 patients. The observed
rates of LRF are similar to those reported more than a decade ago, suggesting
that local/regional control remains a persistent problem. The use of additional
local treatments, such as radiotherapy, should be reevaluated to further improve 
outcomes.

Purpose The aim of the current study was to characterize the risk of interval
invasive second breast cancers within 5 years of primary breast cancer treatment.
Methods We examined 65,084 surveillance mammograms from 18,366 women with a
primary breast cancer diagnosis of unilateral ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I
to III invasive breast carcinoma performed from 1996 to 2012 in the Breast Cancer
Surveillance Consortium. Interval invasive breast cancer was defined as
ipsilateral or contralateral cancer diagnosed within 1 year after a negative
surveillance mammogram. Discrete-time survival models-adjusted for all
covariates-were used to estimate the probability of interval invasive cancer,
given the risk factors for each surveillance round, and aggregated across rounds 
to estimate the 5-year cumulative probability of interval invasive cancer.
Results We observed 474 surveillance-detected cancers-334 invasive and 140 ductal
carcinoma in situ-and 186 interval invasive cancers which yielded a cancer
detection rate of 7.3 per 1,000 examinations (95% CI, 6.6 to 8.0) and an interval
invasive cancer rate of 2.9 per 1,000 examinations (95% CI, 2.5 to 3.3). Median
cumulative 5-year interval cancer risk was 1.4% (interquartile range, 0.8% to
2.3%; 10th to 90th percentile range, 0.5% to 3.7%), and 15% of women had ≥ 3%
5-year interval invasive cancer risk. Cumulative 5-year interval cancer risk was 
highest for women with estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative
primary breast cancer (2.6%; 95% CI, 1.7% to 3.5%), interval cancer presentation 
at primary diagnosis (2.2%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 2.9%), and breast conservation
without radiation (1.8%; 95% CI, 1.1% to 2.4%). Conclusion Risk of interval
invasive second breast cancer varies across women and is influenced by
characteristics that can be measured at initial diagnosis, treatment, and
imaging. Risk prediction models that evaluate the risk of cancers not detected by
surveillance mammography should be developed to inform discussions of tailored
surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Statin use is associated with lower advanced prostate cancer risk and
reduced prostate cancer-specific mortality, but prior studies were conducted
mainly in white men. We examined the effect of statin use on risk of prostate
cancer progression in a population-based, minority-enriched cohort.
METHODS: We used data from prostate cancer cases (45% African American) diagnosed
between 2004 and 2007 who participated in the Health Care Access and Prostate
Cancer Treatment in North Carolina cohort (HCaP-NC). We abstracted statin use at 
diagnosis. Men reported if they had ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine associations 
between statin use and risk of prostate cancer progression (biochemical
recurrence or secondary treatment), overall and by race. In secondary analysis,
we examined the association between high cholesterol and risk of progression,
overall, and by statin use.
RESULTS: Of 669 men, 244 (36%) were statin users at diagnosis. During 3.8 years
median follow-up, 138 men experienced prostate cancer progression. There was no
association between statin use and risk of progression, either overall (HR 1.03; 
95%CI 0.72-1.46) or stratified by race. High cholesterol was inversely associated
with risk of progression, particularly among statin users (HR 0.43; 95%CI
0.20-0.94; p-interaction = 0.22) and in men with higher perceived access to care 
(HR 0.57; 95%CI 0.36-0.90; p-interaction = 0.03). Study limitations included a
relatively small sample size, short follow-up, and lack of data regarding post
diagnosis statin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin use at diagnosis was not associated with prostate cancer
progression in the population-based, minority-enriched HCaP-NC. Greater
healthcare engagement, including actively controlling serum cholesterol, may be
linked to better prostate cancer-specific outcomes.

Purpose: After failure of hypomethylating agents (HMA), patients with
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have dismal survival and no approved treatment
options.Patients and Methods: We conducted a phase 1b investigator-initiated
trial of ipilimumab in patients with higher risk MDS who have failed HMAs.
Patients received monotherapy at two dose levels (DL; 3 and 10 mg/kg) with an
induction followed by a maintenance phase. Toxicities and responses were
evaluated with CTCAE.4 and IWG-2006 criteria, respectively. We also performed
immunologic assays and T-cell receptor sequencing on serial samples.Results:
Twenty-nine patients from 7 centers were enrolled. In the initial DL1 (3 mg), 3
of 6 patients experienced grade 2-4 immune-related adverse events (IRAE) that
were reversible with drug discontinuation and/or systemic steroids. In DL2, 4 of 
5 patients experienced grade 2 or higher IRAE; thus, DL1 (3 mg/kg) was expanded
with no grade 2-4 IRAEs reported in 18 additional patients. Best responses
included marrow complete response (mCR) in one patient (3.4%). Prolonged stable
disease (PSD) for ≥46 weeks occurred in 7 patients (24% of entire cohort and 29% 
of those treated with 3 mg/kg dose), including 3 patients with more than a year
of SD. Five patients underwent allografting without excessive toxicity. Median
survival for the group was 294 days (95% CI, 240-671+). Patients who achieved PSD
or mCR had significantly higher frequency of T cells expressing ICOS (inducible
T-cell co-stimulator).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ipilimumab dosed at 
3 mg/kg in patients with MDS after HMA failure is safe but has limited efficacy
as a monotherapy. Increased frequency of ICOS-expressing T cells might predict
clinical benefit. Clin Cancer Res; 24(15); 3519-27. ©2018 AACR.

The case against endometrial ablation for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.

Author information: 
(1)University of North Carolina.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Endometrial ablation is a common treatment for heavy menstrual
bleeding, but serious limitations and long-term complications exist. Our purpose 
is to summarize the use of endometrial ablation devices, potential short-term and
long-term complications, cost effectiveness, and quality of life in relation to
alternative treatments.
RECENT FINDINGS: There is insufficient evidence to strongly recommend one
endometrial ablation device over another. Providers should consider and discuss
with their patients, complications including risk of future pregnancy,
endometrial cancer, and hysterectomy for continued bleeding or pain. Patient
selection is key to reducing postablation pain and failure; patients with a
history of tubal ligation and dysmenorrhea should consider alternative
treatments. All patients should also be counseled that the levonorgestrel
intrauterine device is a cost-effective alternative with higher quality of life
and fewer complications. Hysterectomy is definitive treatment with higher quality
of life and fewer complications.
SUMMARY: Although endometrial ablation can offer adequate symptom control for
patients who have failed medical therapy, desire uterine preservation, or who are
high-risk surgical candidates, patients should be appropriately selected and
counseled regarding the potential for treatment failure and long-term
complications.

Tyro3, Axl, Mer (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases reduce inflammatory, innate
immune responses. We demonstrate that tumor-secreted protein S (Pros1), a
Mer/Tyro3 ligand, decreased macrophage M1 cytokine expression in vitro and in
vivo. In contrast, tumor cells with CRISPR-based deletion of Pros1 failed to
inhibit M1 polarization. Tumor cell-associated Pros1 action was abrogated in
macrophages from Mer- and Tyro3- but not Axl-KO mice. In addition, several other 
murine and human tumor cell lines suppressed macrophage M1 cytokine expression
induced by IFN-γ and LPS. Investigation of the suppressive pathway demonstrated a
role for PTP1b complexing with Mer. Substantiating the role of PTP1b, M1 cytokine
suppression was also lost in macrophages from PTP1b-KO mice. Mice bearing
Pros1-deficient tumors showed increased innate and adaptive immune infiltration, 
as well as increased median survival. TAM activation can also inhibit
TLR-mediated M1 polarization. Treatment with resiquimod, a TLR7/8 agonist, did
not improve survival in mice bearing Pros1-secreting tumors but doubled survival 
for Pros1-deleted tumors. The tumor-derived Pros1 immune suppressive system, like
PD-L1, was cytokine responsive, with IFN-γ inducing Pros1 transcription and
secretion. Inhibition of Pros1/TAM interaction represents a potential novel
strategy to block tumor-derived immune suppression.

BACKGROUND: Falls in older adults with cancer are common, yet factors associated 
with fall-risk are not well-defined and may differ from the general geriatric
population. This study aims to develop and validate a model of factors associated
with prior falls among older adults with cancer.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional secondary analysis, two cohorts of patients aged
≥ 65 with cancer were examined to develop and validate a model of factors
associated with falls in the prior 6 months. Potential independent variables,
including demographic and laboratory data and a geriatric assessment
(encompassing comorbidities, functional status, physical performance,
medications, and psychosocial status), were identified. A multivariate model was 
developed in the derivation cohort using an exhaustive modeling approach. The
model selected for validation offered a low Akaike Information Criteria value and
included dichotomized variables for ease of clinical use. This model was then
applied in the validation cohort.
RESULTS: The development cohort (N = 498) had a mean age of 73 (range 65-91).
Nearly one-fifth (18.2%) reported a fall in the prior 6 months. The selected
model comprised nine variables involving functional status, objective physical
performance, depression, medications, and renal function. The AUC of the model
was 0.72 (95% confidence intervals 0.65-0.78). In the validation cohort
(N = 250), the prevalence of prior falls was 23.6%. The AUC of the model in the
validation cohort was 0.62 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.71).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed and validated a model of factors
associated with prior falls in older adults with cancer. Future study is needed
to examine the utility of such a model in prospectively predicting incident
falls.

In order to explore the mechanism of the reversing multidrug resistance (MDR)
phenotypes by β-elemene (β-ELE) in doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant breast cancer
cells (MCF-7/DOX), both the functionality and quantity of the ABC transporters in
MCF-7/DOX were studied. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to study the
efflux of d-luciferin potassium salt, the substrate of ATP-binding cassette
transporters (ABC transporters), in MCF-7/DOX cells treated by β-ELE. At the same
time three major ABC transport proteins and genes-related MDR, P-glycoprotein
(P-gp, ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP, ABCC1) as well 
as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) were analyzed by q-PCR and
Western blot. To investigate the efflux functionality of ABC transporters,
MCF-7/DOXFluc cell line with stably-overexpressed luciferase was established. BLI
was then used to real-time monitor the efflux kinetics of d-luciferin potassium
salt before and after MCF-7/DOXFluc cells being treated with β-ELE or not. The
results showed that the efflux of d-luciferin potassium salt from MCF-7/DOXFluc
was lessened when pretreated with β-ELE, which means that β-ELE may dampen the
functionality of ABC transporters, thus decrease the efflux of d-fluorescein
potassium or other chemotherapies which also serve as the substrates of ABC
transporters. As the effect of β-ELE on the expression of ABC transporters, the
results of q-PCR and Western blot showed that gene and protein expression of ABC 
transporters such as P-gp, MRP, and BCRP were down-regulated after the treatment 
of β-ELE. To verify the efficacy of β-ELE on reversing MDR, MCF-7/DOX cells were 
treated with the combination of DOX and β-ELE. MTT assay showed that β-ELE
increased the inhibitory effect of DOX on the proliferation of MCF-7/DOX, and the
IC50 of the combination group was much lower than that of the single DOX or β-ELE
treatment. In all, β-ELE may reverse MDR through the substrates of ABC
transporters by two ways, to lessen the ABC protein efflux by weakening their
functionality, or to reduce the quantity of ABC gene and protein expression.

BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides have
been associated with altered thyroid hormone levels in humans, but their
relationship with thyroid cancer is unknown.
METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study of thyroid cancer in the
Norwegian Janus Serum Bank cohort using pre-diagnostic blood samples from 1972 to
1985. Incident thyroid cancer (n = 108) was ascertained through 2008. Controls
were matched 2:1 by age, date of blood draw, gender, and county. We used gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry to quantify 36 PCB congeners and metabolites of 
pesticides DDT, chlordane, hexachlorocyclohexane, and hexachlorobenzene. PCBs and
pesticide metabolites were evaluated individually and summed by degree of
chlorination and parent compound, respectively. Odds ratios (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were computed using conditional logistic regression per
specified increase in lipid-adjusted concentration. We additionally stratified
analyses by birth cohort (1923-1932, 1933-1942, 1943-1957).
RESULTS: Increasing concentration of DDT metabolites (ORper 1000 ng/g = 0.80,
95%CI = 0.66-0.98) was inversely associated with thyroid cancer. Associations for
PCBs were null or in inverse direction. We observed interactions for total PCBs, 
moderately-chlorinated PCBs, and chlordane metabolites with birth cohort
(p ≤ 0.04). Among participants born 1943-1957, total PCBs (ORper 100 ng/g = 1.25,
95%CI = 1.00-1.56), moderately-chlorinated PCBs (ORper 100 ng/g = 1.31, 95%CI =
1.01-1.70), and chlordane metabolites (ORper 10 ng/g = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.09-2.93)
were positively associated with thyroid cancer. For individuals born before 1943,
associations were generally null or in the inverse direction.
CONCLUSIONS: Emissions of PCBs and OC pesticides varied over time. Different risk
patterns by birth cohort suggest the potential importance of timing of exposure
in thyroid cancer risk. Further evaluation of these associations is warranted.

The advent of multifunctional nanoparticle has enabled numerous innovative
strategies in diagnostics, imaging, and cancer therapy. Despite the intense
research efforts in developing new nanoparticles and surface bonding ligands, one
major obstacle in achieving highly effective treatment, including minimizing
detrimental side effects, is the inability to deliver drug-carrying nanoparticles
from the injection point directly to the tumor site. The present study seeks to
employ a direct nanodrug delivery methodology to feed multifunctional
nanoparticles directly to tumor vasculatures, sparing healthy tissue. An
important aspect to examine is how the interactions between such nanoparticles
and relatively large red blood cells would affect the transport and delivery
efficiency of nanodrugs. So, a novel computer simulation model has been developed
to study nanoparticle transport in a representative human hepatic artery system, 
subject to shear-induced diffusion of nanoparticles due to hydrodynamic
interactions with red blood cells. The particle-size effect was also evaluated by
comparing the dynamics of nanoparticles with microspheres. Results from computer 
simulations under physiologically realistic conditions indicate that
shear-induced diffusion has a significant effect on nanoparticle transport, even 
in large arteries. Nevertheless, as documented, direct nanodrug delivery to
tumor-feeding hepatic artery branches is feasible. Graphical abstract Direct
nanodrug delivery from injection point to tumor-feeding artery branch.

Combination immunotherapy has recently emerged as a powerful cancer treatment
strategy. A promising treatment approach utilizes coadministration of
antagonistic antibodies to block checkpoint inhibitor receptors, such as
antiprogrammed cell death-1 (aPD1), alongside agonistic antibodies to activate
costimulatory receptors, such as antitumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
member 4 (aOX40). Optimal T-cell activation is achieved when both
immunomodulatory agents simultaneously engage T-cells and promote synergistic
proactivation signaling. However, standard administration of these therapeutics
as free antibodies results in suboptimal T-cell binding events, with only a
subset of the T-cells binding to both aPD1 and aOX40. Here, it is shown that
precise spatiotemporal codelivery of aPD1 and aOX40 using nanoparticles (NP)
(dual immunotherapy nanoparticles, DINP) results in improved T-cell activation,
enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and increased immunological memory. It is
demonstrated that DINP elicits higher rates of T-cell activation in vitro than
free antibodies. Importantly, it is demonstrated in two tumor models that
combination immunotherapy administered in the form of DINP is more effective than
the same regimen administered as free antibodies. This work demonstrates a novel 
strategy to improve combination immunotherapy using nanotechnology.

Purpose: Immune checkpoint inhibitors designed to revert tumor-induced
immunosuppression have emerged as potent anticancer therapies. Tryptophan
metabolism represents an immune checkpoint, and targeting this pathway's
rate-limiting enzyme IDO1 is actively being investigated clinically. Here, we
studied the intermediary metabolism of tryptophan metabolism in glioblastoma and 
evaluated the activity of the IDO1 inhibitor GDC-0919, both alone and in
combination with radiation (RT).Experimental Design: LC/GC-MS and expression
profiling was performed for metabolomic and genomic analyses of patient-derived
glioma. Immunocompetent mice were injected orthotopically with genetically
engineered murine glioma cells and treated with GDC-0919 alone or combined with
RT. Flow cytometry was performed on isolated tumors to determine immune
consequences of individual treatments.Results: Integrated cross-platform analyses
coupling global metabolomic and gene expression profiling identified aberrant
tryptophan metabolism as a metabolic node specific to the mesenchymal and
classical subtypes of glioblastoma. GDC-0919 demonstrated potent inhibition of
this node and effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier. Although GDC-0919 as a
single agent did not demonstrate antitumor activity, it had a strong potential
for enhancing RT response in glioblastoma, which was further augmented with a
hypofractionated regimen. RT response in glioblastoma involves immune
stimulation, reflected by increases in activated and cytotoxic T cells, which was
balanced by immune checkpoint reactivation, reflected by an increase in IDO1
expression and regulatory T cells (Treg). GDC-0919 mitigated RT-induced Tregs and
enhanced T-cell activation.Conclusions: Tryptophan metabolism represents a
metabolic node in glioblastoma, and combining RT with IDO1 inhibition enhances
therapeutic response by mitigating RT-induced immunosuppression. Clin Cancer Res;

BACKGROUND:  Serrated polyps are important colorectal cancer precursors that are 
variably detected during colonoscopy. We measured serrated polyp detection rate
(SPDR) in a large, multicenter, cross-sectional study of colonoscopy quality to
identify drivers of SPDR variation.
METHODS:  Colonoscopy and pathology reports were collected for a 2-year period
(10/2013-9/2015) from four sites across the United States. Data from reports,
including size, location, and histology of polyps, were abstracted using a
validated natural language processing algorithm. SPDR was defined as the
proportion of colonoscopies with ≥ 1 serrated polyp (not including hyperplastic
polyps). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine endoscopist
characteristics associated with serrated polyp detection.
RESULTS:  A total of 104 618 colonoscopies were performed by 201 endoscopists who
varied with respect to specialty (86 % were gastroenterologists), sex (18 %
female), years in practice (range 1 - 51), and number of colonoscopies performed 
during the study period (range 30 - 2654). The overall mean SPDR was 5.1 % (SD
3.8 %, range 0 - 18.8 %). In multivariable analysis, gastroenterology specialty
training (odds ratio [OR] 1.89, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.33 - 2.70), fewer
years in practice (≤ 9 years vs. ≥ 27 years: OR 1.52, 95 %CI 1.14 - 2.04)], and
higher procedure volumes (highest vs. lowest quartile: OR 1.77, 95 %CI
1.27 - 2.46)] were independently associated with serrated polyp detection.
CONCLUSIONS:  Gastroenterology specialization, more recent completion of
training, and greater procedure volume are associated with serrated polyp
detection. These findings imply that both repetition and training are likely to
be important contributors to adequate detection of these important cancer
precursors. Additional efforts to improve SPDR are needed.

Radiation therapy (RT) plays an important role in the management of breast
cancer. Radiation-induced fibrosis is a side effect of radiation therapy and may 
occur in up to 13% of the cases in patients (Radiother Oncol, 2009;90:80),
fortunately usually is modest/localized and not associated with marked symptoms. 
However, occasionally, fibrosis can be moderate-to-severe, and cause
clinically-meaningful symptoms. The current review summarizes the use of
pentoxifylline and vitamin E of treatment or prevention of radiation-induced
fibrosis in breast cancer patients. Even though data are limited, this regimen
may reduce RT-associated toxicity.

Although colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death in Morocco, there 
are no studies of the microbiome changes associated with the disease in the
Moroccan population. The aim of our study was to compare the stool microbiome of 
Moroccan cancer patients with healthy individuals. We analyzed the microbiome
composition of samples from 11 CRC patients and 12 healthy individuals by 16S
rRNA amplicon sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis of samples revealed
defined cancer versus healthy clusters. Our findings showed that cancer samples
had higher proportions of Firmicutes (T = 50.5%; N = 28.4%; p = 0.04),
specifically of Clostridia (T = 48.3%; N = 19.0%; p = 0.002), and Fusobacteria
(T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; p = 0.02), especially of Fusobacteriia (T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; 
p = 0.02), while Bacteroidetes were enriched in healthy samples (T = 35.1%;
N = 62.8%; p = 0.06), particularly the class Bacteroidia (T = 35.1%; N = 62.6%;
p = 0.06). Porphyromonas, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Selenomonas, and
Fusobacterium were significantly overrepresented in diseased patients, similarly 
to other studies. Predicted functional information showed that bacterial motility
proteins, flagellar assembly, and fatty acid biosynthesis metabolism were
significantly overrepresented in cancer patients, while amino acid metabolism and
glycan biosynthesis were overrepresented in controls. This suggests that
involvement of these functional metagenomes is similar and relevant in the
carcinogenesis process, independent of the origin of the samples. Results from
this study allowed identification of bacterial taxa relevant to the Moroccan
population and encourages larger studies to facilitate population-directed
therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: self-expandable metal stents are often used for the palliative
treatment of dysphagia in patients with advanced esophageal cancer and an
anticipated limited survival. Due to previous reports of a high rate of adverse
event when used long-term, concerns have been raised with regard to the use of
self-expandable metal stents in patients with a longer survival.
AIM: assess the role of esophageal self-expandable metal stents in patients with 
advanced esophageal cancer that have survived longer than six months.
METHODS: retrospective study of patients with advanced esophageal cancer with a
self-expandable metal stent and a stent placement time greater than six months.
RESULTS: forty-two patients were followed up for 298 days. There was a clinical
improvement in all patients. However, 59% of patients experienced an adverse
event. The median stent patency was 236 days. Endoscopic management was attempted
in all self-expandable metal related adverse events, with a clinical success rate
of 100%. However, the previously treated adverse event recurred in seven
patients. Multivariate analysis showed that strictures that were traversable with
an ultrathin gastroscope were associated with a higher risk of adverse events (p 
= 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: long-term esophageal stenting in patients with advanced esophageal
cancer is associated with a high prevalence of adverse events without an impact
on mortality; most cases can be managed endoscopically.

OBJECTIVES: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery
(PDS) for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) remains controversial in the 
United States. Generalizability of existing trial results has been criticized
because of less aggressive debulking procedures than commonly used in the United 
States. As a result, economic evaluations using input data from these trials may 
not accurately reflect costs and outcomes associated with more aggressive primary
surgery. Using data from an ongoing trial performing aggressive debulking, we
investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of NACT versus PDS for AEOC.
METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to estimate differences in
short-term outcomes and costs for a hypothetical cohort of 15,000 AEOC patients
(US annual incidence of AEOC) treated with NACT versus PDS over a 1-year time
horizon from a Medicare payer perspective. Outcomes included costs per
cancer-related death averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) 
gained. Base-case probabilities, costs, and utilities were based on the Surgical 
Complications Related to Primary or Interval Debulking in Ovarian Neoplasms
trial. Base-case analyses assumed equivalent survival; threshold analysis
estimated the maximum survival difference that would result in NACT being
cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to characterize model uncertainty.
RESULTS: Compared with PDS, NACT was associated with $142 million in cost
savings, 1098 fewer cancer-related deaths, and 1355 life-years and 1715 QALYs
gained, making it the dominant treatment strategy for all outcomes. In
sensitivity analysis, NACT remained dominant in 99.3% of simulations. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy remained cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY
willingness-to-pay thresholds if survival differences were less than 2.7 and 1.4 
months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, NACT is cost-saving with improved outcomes.
However, if PDS provides a longer-term survival advantage, it may be
cost-effective. Research is needed on the role of patient preferences in
tradeoffs between survival and quality of life.

BACKGROUND: There are multiple known individual- and practice-level barriers to
enrollment of older patients with cancer to clinical trials, but little is known 
about how the clinical research workforce feels about potential higher-level
strategy changes aimed to promote increased enrollment of older patients.
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: We invited all 11,351 Alliance for Clinical
Trials in Oncology ("Alliance") members to participate in an anonymous, web-based
survey to examine awareness of current accrual patterns for older patients to
clinical trials, to ascertain consensus on how to tackle enrollment challenges,
and to provide the impetus for high-level changes to improve clinical trial
accrual of older patients with cancer.
RESULTS: During the period from February 28, 2017, to June 16, 2017, 1,146
Alliance members participated (response rate = 10%), including a national diverse
sample of physicians, nurses, administrative/clinical research staff, and patient
advocates with representation from community, academic, and rural sites. Overall,
one third felt that >50% of clinical trial enrollees should be age ≥65, and 64.9%
felt the Alliance could improve upon enrollment of older patients. The four most 
commonly ranked strategies to improve enrollment of older patients were creating 
more dedicated trials for this population (36.3%), minimizing exclusion criteria 
focused on comorbidity (35.5%), developing independent strategies for those aged 
≥65 and for those aged ≥70 (33.2%), and requiring that most/all Alliance trials
have a specific expansion cohort of older patients (30.0%).
CONCLUSION: We anticipate that the recommendations from >1,000 Alliance members
will continue to propel important strategy changes aimed to improve accrual of
older patients with cancer to clinical trials.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This survey of the Alliance for Clinical Trials
membership sought opinions on potential, large-scale, national strategies to
improve accrual of older adults with cancer. Consensus was found around multiple 
strategies, including creating more dedicated trials for older patients,
developing less stringent eligibility criteria, and mandating expansion cohorts
of older patients within broader Alliance trials. It is anticipated that the
recommendations from >1,000 Alliance members will continue to propel important
strategy changes aimed to improve accrual of older patients with cancer to
clinical trials.

OBJECTIVE: Older patients with cancer suffer from chemotherapy-related toxicities
more frequently than younger patients. As novel agents are being used more
commonly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
toxicities of these agents in older patients have not been well studied. Further,
impact of these toxicities on outcomes in the elderly is unknown. This study
aimed to answer both questions.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 14 Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology
trials that enrolled CLL and/or NHL patients between 2004-2014. Toxicity was
assessed per the NCI-CTCAE (version 3-5). Probabilities of experiencing grade
three or four hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were modeled as a
function of clinical and disease-related factors using logistic regression.
RESULTS: 1199 patients (409 age ≥ 65; 790 age < 65) were analyzed; 438 received
only biologic therapy (145 age ≥ 65; 293 age < 65), and 761 received
biologic + chemotherapy (264 age ≥ 65; 497 age < 65). The odds of grade three or 
four hematologic [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; p = 0.009: 95% CI (1.57-1.84)] and
non-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.47; p = 0.022; 95% CI (1.39-1.55)] were
increased in older patients with CLL, as well as odds of grade three or four
non-hematologic toxicities [OR 1.89; p = 0.017; 95% CI (1.64-2.17)] in older
patients with NHL. Grade three or four hematologic toxicities were associated
with inferior OS and PFS in older patients with NHL [HR 3.14; p = 0.006; 95% CI
(2.25-4.39) for OS and 3.06; p = 0.011; 95% CI (2.10-4.45) for PFS], though not
in CLL. A prognostic model predicting grade three or four toxicities was also
developed.
CONCLUSIONS: CLL and NHL patients ≥ 65 year encounter more toxicities than
younger patients even when treated with novel biologic agents. Development of
grade three or four hematologic toxicities lead to inferior PFS and OS in NHL but
not in CLL.

Background: Prostate cancer incidence rates vary 25-fold worldwide. Differences
in PSA screening are largely, but not entirely, responsible. We examined
geographic differences in prevalence of histologic prostate inflammation and
subsequent prostate cancer risk.Methods: Seven thousand nonHispanic white men
were enrolled in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) 
trial from Europe (n = 4,644), North America (n = 1,746), South America (n =
466), and Australia/New Zealand (n = 144). Histologic inflammation in baseline
negative prostate biopsies was classified as chronic (lymphocytes/macrophages) or
acute (neutrophils). Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine
associations between region and prostate inflammation, and between region and
prostate cancer risk at 2-year biopsy.Results: Prevalence of prostate
inflammation varied across region, with broadly similar patterns for acute and
chronic inflammation. Relative to Europe, prevalence of acute inflammation was
higher in North America [odds ratio (OR), 1.77; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.51-2.08] and Australia/New Zealand (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.40-3.06). Men from
these regions had lower prostate cancer risk than Europeans at biopsy. Among
North Americans, prevalence of acute inflammation was higher in Canada versus the
United States (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83), but prostate cancer risk did not
differ between these regions. Among Europeans, prevalence of acute inflammation
was lower in Northern and Eastern (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97 and OR 0.62; 95%
CI, 0.45-0.87, respectively), relative to Western Europe, and these men had
higher prostate cancer risk at biopsy.Conclusions: Prevalence of histologic
prostate inflammation varied by region. Geographic differences in prostate
inflammation tracked inversely with geographic differences in prostate cancer
risk.Impact: Characterization of premalignant prostate biology and the
relationship with subsequent prostate cancer risk could inform prostate cancer
prevention efforts. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 27(7); 783-9. ©2018 AACR.

Purpose Racial variation in the financial impact of cancer may contribute to
observed differences in the use of guideline-recommended treatments. We describe 
racial differences with regard to the financial impact of breast cancer in a
large population-based prospective cohort study. Methods The Carolina Breast
Cancer Study oversampled black women and women younger than age 50 years with
incident breast cancer in North Carolina from 2008 to 2013. Participants provided
medical records and data regarding demographics, socioeconomic status, and
financial impact of cancer at 5 and 25 months postdiagnosis. We report unadjusted
and adjusted financial impact at 25 months postdiagnosis by race. Results The
sample included 2,494 women who completed follow-up surveys (49% black, 51%
white). Since diagnosis, 58% of black women reported any adverse financial impact
of cancer ( v 39% of white women; P < .001). In models adjusted for age, stage at
diagnosis, and treatment received, black women were more likely to report adverse
financial impact attributable to cancer (adjusted risk difference [aRD], +14
percentage points; P < .001), including income loss (aRD, +10 percentage points; 
P < .001), health care-related financial barriers (aRD, +10 percentage points; P 
< .001), health care-related transportation barriers (aRD, +10 percentage points;
P < .001), job loss (aRD, 6 percentage points; P < .001), and loss of health
insurance (aRD, +3 percentage points; P < .001). The effect of race was
attenuated when socioeconomic factors were included but remained significant for 
job loss, transportation barriers, income loss, and overall financial impact.
Conclusion Compared with white women, black women with breast cancer experience a
significantly worse financial impact. Disproportionate financial strain may
contribute to higher stress, lower treatment compliance, and worse outcomes by
race. Policies that help to limit the effect of cancer-related financial strain
are needed.

Exercise training reduces the side effects of cancer treatments; however, the
stress hormone response to acute exercise during prostate cancer (PCa) treatment 
is unclear. The study purpose was to examine the effects of acute exercise on
circulating cortisol, epinephrine (Epi), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations
during PCa treatment with and without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Men
with PCa (n = 11), with PCa on ADT (n = 11), and with non-cancer controls (n = 8)
had blood samples for stress hormones collected before and immediately (0 hour), 
2 hours, and 24 hours after 45 minutes of intermittent cycling at 60% of peak
wattage. NE increased by 385% (P < .001) at 0 hour and remained elevated at
2 hours (P < .05) with no group differences. Overall, cortisol significantly
increased at 0 hour (36%, P < .012) and then significantly decreased below
baseline at 2 hours (-24%, P < .001) before returning to resting levels at
24 hours. Cortisol levels during ADT were 32% lower than PCa (P = .006) with no
differences vs controls. Epi increased immediately after exercise more in
controls (817%, P < .001) than with ADT (700%) and PCa (333%) patients, and both 
cancer groups' absolute levels were attenuated relative to controls (ADT: -54%,
PCa: -52%, P = .004). Compared with age-matched controls, PCa and ADT patients
exhibited similar stress hormone responses with acute exercise for NE and
cortisol but an attenuated EPI response that suggests altered adrenal function.
Future studies should examine the physical stress of multiple exercise bouts to
verify these findings and to explore the functional hormonal effects, such as
immune and metabolic responses, during cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: High-oncogenic-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is necessary,
although insufficient, to promote cervical cancer. Like HPV, Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) is a common pathogen with the capacity to promote epithelial neoplasms. We 
examined the association between cervical EBV, hrHPV, and cytology in female sex 
workers in Nairobi, Kenya.
METHODS: Women (n = 332) with known cervical cytology and hrHPV mRNA results were
evaluated for cervical EBV DNA by conventional polymerase chain reaction.
Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated to assess the relationships between EBV, 
hrHPV, and cervical cytology. Prospective analyses used risk ratios and
time-to-event analyses to determine the association of EBV with hrHPV clearance
and with abnormal cytology outcomes.
RESULTS: Baseline prevalence of hrHPV and EBV was 29% and 19%, respectively.
Higher EBV prevalence was found among women with older age, HIV, hrHPV, abnormal 
cytology, Mycoplasma genitalium infection, smoking habits, younger age at sexual 
debut, and less frequent condom use. At baseline, women with EBV had a higher
prevalence of hrHPV infection than did EBV-negative women (52% vs. 24%;
HIV-adjusted PR [95% confidence interval], 1.8 [1.3-2.6]). Epstein-Barr
virus-positive women had a higher prevalence than did EBV-negative women of
high-grade precancer (15% vs. 2%) and abnormal cytology (37% vs. 15%), although
HIV- and hrHPV-adjusted associations were not significant (high-grade precancer: 
PR, 2.0 [0.7-5.9]; abnormal cytology: PR, 1.4 [0.9-2.2]). In prospective
analyses, a marginal association was observed between baseline EBV detection and 
delayed hrHPV clearance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible role for EBV as a high-risk marker or
cofactor for HPV-mediated cervical cancer development.

BACKGROUND: Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer seek information on how 
treatment options may impact their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The
authors used latent profile analysis (LPA) to group men according to their
symptom burden and functional status and to identify patient characteristics
associated with each HRQOL profile.
METHODS: Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite measures 3 months after
treatment initiation. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,
diarrhea, urinary obstruction, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and sex
satisfaction were modeled jointly using LPA, and the analysis was adjusted for
covariates to examine associations between patient characteristics and profiles.
RESULTS: One-third of the 373 men were not non-Hispanic white (26% were black).
Four LPA profiles were identified. Men who experienced the "best HRQOL" were less
likely to receive treatment, to be older, and to smoke. Men in the second best
profile experienced symptoms similar to men in the best HRQOL group but reported 
poor sexual and urinary function, because they were more likely to receive
therapy. The third profile included men with increased symptom burden and poor
functioning who were likely to undergo prostatectomy and to have increased
comorbidity. The "worst HRQOL" group experienced the worst symptoms and the
poorest functioning, and these men were more likely to be younger, to have more
comorbidities, and to smoke.
CONCLUSIONS: LPA revealed that men who receive the same treatment can experience 
very different HRQOL impact. Understanding the factors most associated with
poorer HRQOL allows clinicians to focus their care on individuals most in need of
symptom management and support. Cancer 2018;124:2832-2840. © 2018 American Cancer

Background: Adults living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at
increased risk for anal and oropharyngeal cancer caused by human papillomavirus
(HPV). The efficacy of HPV vaccines in this population is unknown.
Methods: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned
HIV-infected adults aged ≥27 years to the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) 
vaccine or placebo (1:1) stratified by sex and presence of anal high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions on biopsy (bHSIL). The primary endpoint was
vaccine efficacy against incident persistent anal infection with quadrivalent
vaccine types or single detection at the final visit that were not present at
baseline. Secondary endpoints included vaccine efficacy for anal bHSIL after week
52, persistent oral HPV infection.
Results: A total of 575 participants were randomized. The Data and Safety
Monitoring Board stopped the study early due to futility. Vaccine efficacy was
22% (95.1% confidence interval [CI], -31%, 53%) for prevention of persistent anal
infection or single detection at the final visit, 0% (95% CI -44%, 31%) for
improving bHSIL outcomes and 88% (95.1% CI 2%, 98%) for preventing persistent
oral HPV infection, but was 32% (95.1% CI -80%, 74%) for 6-month persistent oral 
HPV infection or single detection at the final visit.
Conclusions: These results do not support HPV vaccination of HIV-infected adults 
aged ≥27 years to prevent new anal HPV infections or to improve anal HSIL
outcomes. However, our data suggest a role for prevention of oral HPV infections,
but this finding should be confirmed in future studies.

These years, transformable drug delivery systems (DDSs), which hold the
capability of changing formulation morphology and subsequent functionality at the
desired disease site, have shown great promise in control of spatio-temporal drug
delivery/release manner and enhanced treatment efficacy. Equipped with
controllability and design flexibility, the transformable DDSs are being
increasingly pursued for the development of precision drug delivery platforms for
biomedical applications. In this review, we describe the recently developed
intracelluarly and extracellularly transformable DDSs, especially associated with
assembly or disassociation of the original formulation units, for achieving
various functionalities, including prolonged retention time, inhibited
endocytosis and enhanced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the different stimuli, such
as pH, enzyme, light, temperature, redox and mechanical force that trigger the
transformation process are also introduced. The future outlook and challenges are
discussed in the end.

INTRODUCTION: Faith-based organizations can contribute to improving population
health, but few dissemination and implementation studies exist. This paper
reports countywide adoption, reach, and effectiveness from the Faith, Activity,
and Nutrition dissemination and implementation study.
DESIGN: This was a group-randomized trial. Data were collected in 2016.
Statistical analyses were conducted in 2017.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Churches in a rural, medically underserved county in South 
Carolina were invited to enroll, and attendees of enrolled churches were invited 
to complete questionnaires (n=1,308 participated).
INTERVENTION: Churches (n=59) were randomized to an intervention or control
(delayed intervention) condition. Church committees attended training focused on 
creating opportunities, setting guidelines/policies, sharing messages, and
engaging pastors for physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE). Churches
also received 12 months of telephone-based technical assistance. Community health
advisors provided the training and technical assistance.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption,
Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework guided measurement of adoption and
reach. To assess effectiveness, church attendees completed post-test only
questionnaires of perceptions of church environment, PA and fruit and vegetable
(FV) self-efficacy, FV intake, and PA. Regression models controlled for church
clustering and predominant race of congregation, as well as member age, gender,
education, and self-reported cancer diagnosis.
RESULTS: Church adoption was 42% (55/132). Estimated reach was 3,527,
representing 42% of regular church attendees and 15% of county residents.
Intervention church attendees reported greater church-level PA opportunities, PA 
and HE messages, and PA and HE pastor support (p<0.0001), but not FV
opportunities (p=0.07). PA self-efficacy (p=0.07) and FV self-efficacy (p=0.21)
were not significantly higher in attendees of intervention versus control
churches. The proportion of inactive attendees was lower in intervention versus
control churches (p=0.02). The proportion meeting FV (p=0.27) and PA guidelines
(p=0.32) did not differ by group.
CONCLUSIONS: This innovative dissemination and implementation study had high
adoption and reach with favorable environmental impacts, positioning it for
broader dissemination.

INTRODUCTION: The procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles (EV) exposing
tissue factor (TF) is a promising biomarker for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
cancer patients. We evaluated an in-house EV-TF activity assay (the fibrin
generation test) for the prediction of cancer-associated VTE. We also compared
the results with the fibrin generation tests to an EV-TF-dependent factor Xa
generation assay in samples from pancreatic cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected in a multinational, prospective cohort
study were used. Patients with various types of advanced cancer were enrolled if 
chemotherapy was scheduled or started in the previous 3 months. Patients were
followed for 6 months for the occurrence of VTE. The fibrin generation test was
performed at baseline to measure EV-TF procoagulant activity.
RESULTS: The fibrin generation test was performed in 648 patients with advanced
cancer. The mean age was 62 years; 58% had distant metastasis. Forty patients
(6.1%) developed VTE. Overall, a high fibrin generation test result was
associated with a two-fold increased risk for VTE (HR 2.0; 95%-CI, 1.1-3.6). The 
association was stronger in patients with pancreatic cancer (HR 4.1; 95%-CI,
0.91-19) than in those with other tumor types (HR 1.5; 95%-CI, 0.72-3.1).
Correlation between the FGT and the TF-dependent factor Xa generation assay in
patients with pancreatic cancer was poor (Spearman's R = 0.35).
CONCLUSION: This study shows that a high EV-TF procoagulant activity as measured 
by the fibrin generation test is associated with an increased risk of VTE in
cancer patients, in particular in those with pancreatic cancer. Future studies
should aim to further improve the feasibility and accuracy of EV-TF activity
assays.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE) recurs in 25% or more of patients
treated successfully with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), so surveillance
endoscopy is recommended after complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia
(CEIM). The frequency of surveillance is informed only by expert opinion. We
aimed to model the incidence of neoplastic recurrence, validate the model in an
independent cohort, and propose evidence-based surveillance intervals.
METHODS: We collected data from the United States Radiofrequency Ablation
Registry (US RFA, 2004-2013) and the United Kingdom National Halo Registry (UK
NHR, 2007-2015) to build and validate models to predict the incidence of
neoplasia recurrence after initially successful RFA. We developed 3 categories of
risk and modeled intervals to yield 0.1% risk of recurrence with invasive
adenocarcinoma. We fit Cox proportional hazards models assessing discrimination
by C statistic and 95% confidence limits.
RESULTS: The incidence of neoplastic recurrence was associated with most severe
histologic grade before CEIM, age, endoscopic mucosal resection, sex, and
baseline BE segment length. In multivariate analysis, a model based solely on
most severe pre-CEIM histology predicted neoplastic recurrence with a C statistic
of 0.892 (95% confidence limit, 0.863-0.921) in the US RFA registry. This model
also performed well when we used data from the UK NHR. Our model divided patients
into 3 risk groups based on baseline histologic grade: non-dysplastic BE;
indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade dysplasia; or
intramucosal adenocarcinoma. For patients with low-grade dysplasia, we propose
surveillance endoscopy at 1 and 3 years after CEIM; for patients with high-grade 
dysplasia or intramucosal adenocarcinoma, we propose surveillance endoscopy at
0.25, 0.5, and 1 year after CEIM, then annually.
CONCLUSION: In analyses of data from the US RFA and UK NHR for BE, a
much-attenuated schedule of surveillance endoscopy would provide protection from 
invasive adenocarcinoma. Adherence to the recommended surveillance intervals
could decrease the number of endoscopies performed yet identify unresectable
cancers at rates less than 1/1000 endoscopies.

PURPOSE: Evaluate use of fixed and all-available look-backs to identify
eligibility criteria and confounders among Medicare beneficiaries.
METHODS: We identified outpatient visits (2007-2012) with recently documented
(≤180 days) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether the 
exposure (statin) was initiated within 14 days. We selected each beneficiary's
first eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during the
respective look-backs: continuous enrollment (1 or 3 years for fixed look-back;
180 days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. We
estimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (HRs) for
the effect of statin initiation on incident 6-month cancer (a known null effect) 
and 2-year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using each
look-back.
RESULTS: Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated HR from the all-available
approach (HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.98) was less biased than the 1-year
look-back (HR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.84), which included beneficiaries with
prevalent cancer. The 3-year look-back (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.21) was
somewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due the
exclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuous
enrollment (62.0% and 59.9% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). All 
approaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality.
Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the 3-year
fixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If 3-year look-backs are
infeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferable 
to short (1-year) fixed look-backs.

Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins act in spellchecker roles to excise
misincorporation errors that occur during DNA replication. Curiously, large-scale
analyses of a variety of cancers showed that increased expression of MMR proteins
often correlated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and early recurrence. To 
better understand these observations, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene
Expression across Normal and Tumor tissue databases to analyze MMR protein
expression in cancers. We found that the MMR genes MSH2 and MSH6 are
overexpressed more frequently than MSH3, and that MSH2 and MSH6 are often
cooverexpressed as a result of copy number amplifications of these genes. These
observations encouraged us to test the effects of upregulating MMR protein levels
in baker's yeast, where we can sensitively monitor genome instability phenotypes 
associated with cancer initiation and progression. Msh6 overexpression (two- to
fourfold) almost completely disrupted mechanisms that prevent recombination
between divergent DNA sequences by interacting with the DNA polymerase
processivity clamp PCNA and by sequestering the Sgs1 helicase. Importantly,
cooverexpression of Msh2 and Msh6 (∼eightfold) conferred, in a PCNA
interaction-dependent manner, several genome instability phenotypes including
increased mutation rate, increased sensitivity to the DNA replication inhibitor
HU and the DNA-damaging agents MMS and 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, and elevated
loss-of-heterozygosity. Msh2 and Msh6 cooverexpression also altered the cell
cycle distribution of exponentially growing cells, resulting in an increased
fraction of unbudded cells, consistent with a larger percentage of cells in G1.
These novel observations suggested that overexpression of MSH factors affected
the integrity of the DNA replication fork, causing genome instability phenotypes 
that could be important for promoting cancer progression.

Purpose Standard frontline treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma currently includes sunitinib. A barrier to long-term treatment with
sunitinib includes the development of significant adverse effects, including
diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and fatigue. This trial assessed the effect
of an alternate 2 weeks on, 1 week off (2/1) schedule of sunitinib on toxicity
and efficacy in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma. Methods Patients started with oral administration of 50 mg sunitinib
on a 2/1 schedule and underwent schedule and dose alterations if toxicity
developed. The primary end point was < 15% grade ≥ 3 fatigue, diarrhea, or HFS.
With 60 patients, the upper bound of the CI would fall below the published 4/2
schedule grade ≥ 3 toxicity rate of 25% to 30%. Results Fifty-nine patients were 
treated between August 2014 and March 2016. Seventy-seven percent were
intermediate or poor risk per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria.
With a median follow-up of 17 months, 25% of patients experienced grade 3
fatigue, HFS, or diarrhea; 37% required a dose reduction, and 10% discontinued
because of toxicity. The overall response rate was 57%, median progression-free
survival was 13.7 months, and median overall survival was not reached. At 12
weeks, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scores dropped between 0% 
and 10% from baseline, with less reduction in patients who continued treatment
longer. Conclusion The primary end point of decreased grade 3 toxicity was not
met; however, treatment with a 2/1 sunitinib schedule is associated with a lack
of grade 4 toxicity, a low patient discontinuation rate, and high efficacy.

INTRODUCTION: Bavituximab is an immunomodulatory chimeric monoclonal antibody
that inhibits phosphatidylserine signaling, which promotes innate and adaptive
immune responses. In this phase Ib trial we evaluated the safety, tolerability,
and preliminary antitumor activity of pemetrexed, carboplatin, bavituximab in
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and performance
status 0 or 1 were treated with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and carboplatin area under
the curve 6 once every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, with concurrent bavituximab
(0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg) intravenously weekly, using a standard 3+3 design. At the
maximum identified dose, additional patients were enrolled to further
characterize the safety profile. The primary objective was to characterize the
safety, determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and establish the
recommended phase II dose of bavituximab in combination with pemetrexed and
carboplatin in incurable stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC.
RESULTS: Between March 29, 2011 and December 30, 2013, 26 patients were enrolled.
Three patients each were enrolled into dose escalation cohorts of bavituximab
(0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). Therapy was well tolerated with no DLTs, and toxicities
were consistent with those expected from pemetrexed/carboplatin. Overall response
was 28%, with a median progression-free and overall survival of 4.8 months and
12.2 months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin, bavituximab is well
tolerated. However, with toxicities and preliminary efficacy signal similar to
pemetrexed/carboplatin alone, further studies of bavituximab should focus on ways
to enhance its immunomodulatory role.

We developed measures of benefits and burdens of research participation in cancer
clinical trials using a sequential mixed methods design with a qualitative ( n = 
32) and quantitative sample ( n = 110) of cancer clinical trial participants.
Benefit-burden items (22 for benefits, 23 for burdens) were subsequently
developed and assessed through cognitive interviewing for content, clarity, and
meaning. Preliminary psychometric analyses support the internal consistency
reliability and construct validity of Benefit (α = .90) and Burden (α = .87)
research participation scales. Item response theory models supported the
discrimination ability of the items on the scales. Participants who had thoughts 
of dropping out had lower Benefit scale scores ( p < .001) and higher Burden
scores ( p < .001) than those who had no thoughts of dropping out, supporting
construct validity. With further psychometric testing, the scale can be used to
develop appropriate interventions to address recruitment and retention of human
participants in clinical research.

Most ovarian cancer patients respond well to initial platinum-based chemotherapy.
However, within a year, many patients experience disease recurrence with a
platinum resistant phenotype that responds poorly to second line chemotherapies. 
As a result, new strategies to address platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC)
are needed. Herein, we report that NP co-delivery of cisplatin (CP) and
wortmannin (Wtmn), a DNA repair inhibitor, synergistically enhances
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and reverses CP resistance in PROC. We encapsulated this 
regimen in FDA approved poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)
(PLGA-PEG) NPs to reduce systemic side effects, enhance cellular CP uptake,
improve Wtmn stability, and increase therapeutic efficacy. Treatment of
platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC) and PROC murine models with these
dual-drug loaded NPs (DNPs) significantly reduced tumor burden versus treatment
with combinations of free drugs or single-drug loaded NPs (SNPs). These results
support further investigation of this NP-based, synergistic drug regimen as a
means to combat PROC in the clinic.

Breast cancers detected after a negative breast screening examination and prior
to the next screening are referred to as interval cancers. These cancers
generally have poor clinical characteristics compared with screen-detected
cancers, but associations between interval cancer and genomic cancer
characteristics are not well understood. Mammographically screened women
diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from 1993 to 2013 (n = 370) were
identified by linking the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and the Carolina
Mammography Registry. Among women with a registry-identified screening mammogram 
0 to 24 months before diagnosis, cancers were classified as screen-detected (N = 
165) or interval-detected (N = 205). Using logistic regression, we examined the
association of mode of detection with cancer characteristics (clinical, IHC, and 
genomic), overall, and in analyses stratified on mammographic density and race.
Interval cancer was associated with large tumors [>2 cm; OR, 2.3; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 1.5-3.7], positive nodal status (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8), and
triple-negative subtype (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.5). Interval cancers were more
likely to have non-Luminal A subtype (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7), whereas
screen-detected cancers tended to be more indolent (96% had low risk of
recurrence genomic scores; 71% were PAM50 Luminal A). When stratifying by
mammographic density and race, associations between interval detection and poor
prognostic features were similar by race and density status. Strong associations 
between interval cancers and poor-prognosis genomic features (non-Luminal A
subtype and high risk of recurrence score) suggest that aggressive tumor biology 
is an important contributor to interval cancer rates. Cancer Prev Res; 11(6);

OBJECTIVES: Previous research has reported associations between social
relationships and carcinogenesis. Inflammation is a potential mediator of these
associations. To clarify these links for one tumor site, we examined associations
between social relationships, circulating inflammation markers, and breast cancer
incidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 132,262 participants from the prospective Women's
Health Initiative, we used linear and logistic regression to evaluate
associations between social relationship characteristics (social support, social 
strain, social network size) and inflammation markers of C-reactive protein (CRP)
and white blood cell count (WBC). Cox regression was used to evaluate
associations between inflammation markers and breast cancer incidence, as well as
associations between social relationship characteristics and breast cancer
incidence with and without adjustment for inflammation markers.
RESULTS: Larger social networks were associated with lower continuous CRP
(beta = -0.22, 95% CI -0.36, -0.08) and WBC (beta = -0.23, 95% CI -0.31, -0.16). 
Greater social strain was associated with higher continuous CRP (beta = 0.24, 95%
CI 0.14, 0.33) and WBC (beta = 0.09, 95% CI 0.04, 0.14). When WBC was
dichotomized at 10,000 cells/uL, high WBC was associated with greater hazards of 
in situ breast cancer (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.17, 2.33) but not invasive breast
cancer. Social relationship characteristics were not associated with incidence of
invasive or in situ breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: Larger social networks were associated with lower inflammation and
greater social strain was associated with higher inflammation. Higher
inflammation might be associated with development of in situ breast cancer, but
this appeared to be due to factors other than social relationships.

INTRODUCTION: Time-to-treatment-failure (TTF) is the interval from chemotherapy
initiation to premature discontinuation. We evaluated TTF based on age.
METHODS: Pooled analyses were conducted with first-line chemotherapy trials for
advanced NSCLC (CALGB 9730, 30203, and 30801). Comparisons among patients who
were 65 years and older and 70 years and older were performed for TTF (primary
endpoint), reasons for early chemotherapy cessation, grade 3+ adverse events, and
overall survival.
RESULTS: Among 1006 patients, 460 (46%) were older than 65 years of age. One
hundred forty-five older patients (32% of this age cohort) completed all six
planned chemotherapy cycles as did 170 (32%) younger patients. Median TTF was 2.9
months (95% confidence interval: 2.7- 3.2) in older patients and 3 months (95%
confidence interval: 2.9-3.5) in younger patients; adjustment for performance
status and stratification by chemotherapy by trial yielded no statistically
significant age-based difference in TTF. However, reasons for early chemotherapy 
cessation differed between age groups (multivariate p = 0.004). Older patients
were less likely to discontinue from cancer progression (41% versus 55%) and more
likely from toxicity or patient choice (16% and 15%, respectively) compared to
younger patients (13% and 6%, respectively). Older patients were more likely to
experience grade 3+ adverse events (86% versus 79%) with no statistically
significant difference in survival. An age cutpoint of 70+ years showed no
difference in TTF, a lower trend of early cessation due to cancer progression,
and somewhat shorter older patient survival.
CONCLUSIONS: TTF was comparable between older and younger patients; but
different, age-based, and potentially modifiable reasons account for it.

OBJECTIVES: To model the cost-effectiveness of a biomarker-based approach to
select patients for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before radical cystectomy (RC)
in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We obtained data from the most recent clinical studies on
patients with locally advanced MIBC treated by RC, including stage distributions,
overall survival (OS) estimates, associated costs, and utilisation/response to
NAC. Additionally, we estimated the putative efficacy of three biomarkers to
select patients for NAC: DNA-repair gene panel [ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM), retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), and Fanconi anaemia complementation group C
(FANCC)], excision repair cross-complementation group 2 (ERCC2), and ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) subtypes. A decision analysis model was developed to evaluate the
cost-effectiveness of biomarker-based approaches to select patients with MIBC for
NAC. Comparison of cost-effectiveness included RC alone, unselected NAC plus RC, 
and NAC based on the three aforementioned biomarkers.
RESULTS: The DNA-repair gene panel-based approach to NAC was the most
cost-effective strategy (mean OS of 3.14 years, $31 482/life year). Under this
approach, 38% would undergo NAC, about twice the number of patients who are
currently receiving NAC for MIBC. Such an approach would improve mean OS by 5.2, 
1.6, and 4.4 months compared to RC alone, a hypothetical scenario where all
patients received NAC, and compared to current estimates of NAC utilisation,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: A biomarker-based strategy to identify patients with MIBC who should
undergo NAC was more cost-effective than unselected use of NAC or RC alone. As
further data becomes available, such a model may serve as a basis for
incorporating biomarkers into clinical decision making.

PURPOSE: Effective treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
is a significant unmet clinical need. One major hurdle that exists is inadequate 
drug delivery due to the desmoplastic stroma and poor vascularization that is
characteristic of pancreatic cancer. The local iontophoretic delivery of
chemotherapies provides a novel way of improving treatment. With the growing
practice of highly toxic combination therapies in the treatment of pancreatic
cancer, the use of iontophoresis for local delivery can potentiate the
anti-cancer effects of these therapies while sparing unwanted toxicity. The
objective of this study was to investigate the impact of formulation on the
electro-transport of the FOLFIRINOX regimen for the development of a new
treatment for pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: Three formulations of the FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) were generated at a fixed pH of 6.0 and 
were referred to as formulation A (single drug solution with all four drugs
combined), formulation B (two drug solutions with two drugs per solution), and
formulation C (four individual drug solutions). Anodic iontophoresis of the three
different formulations was evaluated in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts of 
pancreatic cancer.
RESULTS: Iontophoretic transport of the FOLFIRINOX drugs was characterized
according to organ exposure after a single device treatment in vivo. We report
that the co-iontophoresis of two drug solutions, leucovorin + oxaliplatin and
5-fluorouracil + irinotecan, resulted in the highest levels of cytotoxic drugs in
the tumor compared to drugs delivered individually or combined into one solution.
There was no significant difference in plasma, pancreas, kidney, and liver
exposure to the cytotoxic drugs delivered by the three different formulations. In
addition, we found that reducing the duration of iontophoretic treatment from 10 
to 5 min per solution resulted in a significant decrease in drug concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Underlying the difference in drug transport of the formulations was 
electrolyte concentrations, which includes both active and inactive components.
Electrolyte concentrations can hinder or improve drug electro-transport. Overall,
balancing electrolyte concentration is needed for optimal electro-transport.

BACKGROUND: The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC) 
has been proposed to standardize salivary gland fine-needle aspiration (FNA)
diagnoses. This study assessed salivary gland FNA results and risk of malignancy 
(ROM) rates at the University of North Carolina as well as the interobserver
reliability (IOR) of the atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and salivary
gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential (SUMP) categories.
METHODS: The electronic medical record was searched for FNA cases from 2010 to
2017 with subsequent surgical resections. Histologic diagnosis was used for
gold-standard comparison. The original cytologic results were then converted into
MSRSGC categories (nondiagnostic, nonneoplastic, AUS, benign neoplasm, SUMP,
suspicious, and malignant). For the assessment of IOR, 23 cases were selected
with enrichment for cases diagnosed as AUS (n = 11) or SUMP (n = 9). Six boarded 
cytopathologists and 1 cytopathology fellow assessed representative slides and
provided an MSRSGC diagnosis for each case. Fleiss' κ coefficients were
calculated to determine IOR.
RESULTS: The ROM was 33% for both AUS and SUMP cases; however, the risk of
neoplasia was 56% for AUS cases and 100% for SUMP cases. Fleiss' κ for the AUS
category was 0.217 (P < .05), and Fleiss' κ for the SUMP category was 0.024 (P = 
.74).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study assessing the IOR of MSRSGC categories, fair agreement
and slight agreement were found for the AUS and SUMP categories, respectively.
Observers preferentially used the AUS or benign neoplasm category for SUMP cases,
perhaps because of unfamiliarity with SUMP as a diagnostic option. The initial
adoption of a new reporting system will require a quality assessment to ensure
that the system is reliable and useful for clinicians. Cancer Cytopathol

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to determine quality of life and
tumor control from a prospective phase 2 clinical trial evaluating deintensified 
chemoradiotherapy for favorable risk, human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: Patients with T0-T3, N0-N2c, M0, p16-positive disease and a minimal
smoking history were treated with 60 grays of intensity-modulated radiotherapy
with concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatin (30 mg/m2 ). The primary study
endpoint was the pathologic complete response rate based on biopsy of the primary
site and dissection of pretreatment positive lymph node regions. The pathologic
complete response rate as previously reported was 86%. Herein, the authors report
secondary endpoint measures of local control, regional control, cause-specific
survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival, and
patient-reported outcomes (European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30] and the
Patient-Reported Outcomes version of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events [PRO-CTCAE]).
RESULTS: A total of 44 patients enrolled with a median follow-up of 36 months
(88% with ≥2 years). The 3-year local control, regional control, cause-specific
survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival rates were 100%,
100%, 100%, 100%, and 95%, respectively. The mean before and 3-year after EORTC
QOL scores were: global: 80 of 78; swallowing: 11 of 11; dry mouth: 16 of 41; and
sticky saliva: 6 of 29. The mean before and 3-year after PRO-CTCAE scores were:
swallowing: 0.4 of 0.7; and dry mouth: 0.4 of 1.4. Approximately 39% of patients 
required a feeding tube (median duration, 15 weeks; none were permanent). There
were no ≥grade 3 late adverse events reported.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with favorable-risk human papillomavirus-associated
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, a substantially decreased intensity of
therapy with 60 grays of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and weekly low-dose
cisplatin produced better preservation of quality of life compared with standard 
therapies while maintaining excellent 3-year tumor control and survival. Cancer

BACKGROUND: Risk stratification of newly diagnosed patients with mantle cell
lymphoma (MCL) primarily is based on the MCL International Prognostic Index
(MIPI) and Ki-67 proliferative index. Single-center studies have reported
inferior outcomes in patients with a complex karyotype (CK), but this remains an 
area of controversy.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 483 patients from 5 academic
centers in the United States and described the effect of a CK on survival
outcomes in individuals with MCL.
RESULTS: A CK was found to be associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (4.5
vs 11.6 years; P<.01) and progression-free survival (PFS) (1.9 vs 4.4 years;
P<.01). In patients who underwent high-intensity induction followed by autologous
stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in first remission, a CK was associated with
poor OS (5.1 vs 11.6 years; P = .04) and PFS (3.6 vs 7.8 years; P<.01). Among
patients with a CK, high-intensity induction had no effect on OS (4.5 vs 3.8
years; P = .77) nor PFS (2.3 vs 1.5 years; P = .46). Similarly, ASCT in first
remission did not improve PFS (3.5 vs 1.2 years; P = .12) nor OS (5.1 vs 4.0
years; P = .27). On multivariable analyses with Ki-67 and MIPI, only CK was found
to be predictive of OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.12-3.49 [P = .02]), whereas both CK (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.17-3.12 [P =
.01]) and Ki-67 >30% (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.06-3.28 [P = .03]) were associated with
inferior PFS. Multivariable analysis did not identify any specific cytogenetic
abnormalities associated with inferior survival.
CONCLUSIONS: CK appears to be independently associated with inferior outcomes in 
patients with MCL regardless of the intensity of induction therapy and receipt of
ASCT. Cytogenetics should be incorporated into the workup of a new diagnosis of
MCL and novel therapeutic approaches should be investigated for patients with CK.

OBJECTIVES: This study examined the pattern of use and factors predicting
prolonged prescription opioid medications among cancer patients following
treatment with curative intent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with cancer over a 3-year period at a
large urban safety-net hospital were included. Univariate and multivariate
analyses was used to identify factors associated with continued opioid use.
RESULTS: Of the 199 patients included in the study, 38% continued to receive an
opioid prescription well beyond the acute diagnosis and treatment phase. Mean age
was 60.3 years, with a female preponderance (63%). Surgical resection only
(31.6%) and the combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation (19.7%) were 
the commonest treatment modalities. Pain-related comorbidities predating cancer
diagnosis were reported in 53.3% of the patients, and about 33% were also on
pain-modifying medications (odds ratio [OR], 3.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.92-6.77; Fisher exact test P<0.001). Average number of prescriptions received
per patient was 4.8 (range, 1 to 31), over an average of 9.5 months (range, 1.2
to 28.1 mo). Mean morphine milligram equivalents prescribed per prescription was 
319 mg (range, 48 to 2475 mg). According to multivariate model, patients who
received chemotherapy (OR, 7.25; 95% CI, 2.09-25.17; P=0.0018), or pain-modifying
medications (OR, 4.61; 95% CI, 2.25-9.44; P<0.0001) were significantly more
likely to continue to receive prescriptions for opioids.
DISCUSSION: Treatment with chemotherapy, pain-modifying medications, cancer
stage, and interval between diagnosis and treatment are the best predictors for
continuous opioid use. The current epidemic of opioid misuse and abuse makes
examination current practices and identifification of areas of improvement
imperative.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes assessed in extant
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to outcomes that stakeholders expect from
survivorship care plans (SCPs). To facilitate the transition from active
treatment to follow-up care for the 15.5 million US cancer survivors, many
organizations require SCP use. However, results of several RCTs of SCPs'
effectiveness have been null, possibly because they have evaluated outcomes on
which SCPs should be expected to have limited influence. Stakeholders (e.g.,
survivors, oncologists) may expect outcomes that differ from RCTs' outcomes.
METHODS: We identified RCTs' outcomes using a PubMed literature review. We
identified outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs using semistructured
interviews with stakeholders in three healthcare systems in the USA and Canada.
Finally, we mapped RCTs' outcomes onto stakeholder-identified outcomes.
RESULTS: RCT outcomes did not fully address outcomes that stakeholders expected
from SCPs, and RCTs assessed outcomes that stakeholders did not expect from SCPs.
RCTs often assessed outcomes only from survivors' perspectives.
CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of SCPs' effectiveness have not assessed outcomes that
stakeholders expect. To better understand SCPs' effectiveness, future RCTs should
assess outcomes of SCP use that are relevant from the perspective of multiple
stakeholders.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: SCPs' effectiveness may be optimized when used
with an eye toward outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs. For survivors,
this means using SCPs as a map to guide them with respect to what kind of
follow-up care they should seek, when they should seek it, and from whom they
should seek it.

PURPOSE: Cancer survivors are at increased risk for the early development of
age-related chronic medical conditions compared with peers without a history of
cancer; however, little is known regarding the burden of these conditions among
survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancers. In response, we sought to 
determine the prevalence of specific comorbidities and frailty among AYAs (15-39 
years old at diagnosis) enrolled in a cancer survivorship cohort.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey of a tertiary medical center-based cancer
survivorship cohort, we determined the prevalence of specific comorbidities and
frailty using the survey-based FRAIL assessment. In separate models adjusting for
age, we estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) for the associations between patient
characteristics and (1) any comorbidity and (2) frailty or prefrailty using
log-binomial models.
RESULTS: We identified 271 AYA cancer survivors, most of whom were 30-39 years
old at survey (57%). A majority of survivors (n = 163, 60%) reported having at
least one comorbidity with the most common being depression (28%), anxiety (27%),
asthma (17%), high cholesterol (15%), and hypertension (15%). Of the 184 AYA
survivors at least 1 year from cancer diagnosis, 19 (10%) were classified as
frail and 39 (21%) as prefrail. Survivors who were smokers (PR 2.0, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-3.56); obese (PR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.10-2.55);
uninsured (PR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.63-4.59); or who reported comorbid depression or
anxiety (PR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.51-3.67) were more likely to be frail or prefrail.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of frailty and comorbidities is high among AYA cancer
survivors suggestive of accelerated aging.

BACKGROUND: Aspirin may reduce the risk of several types of cancer.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if folic acid is associated with risk of basal cell
carcinoma (BCC).
METHODS: BCC incidence was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial of aspirin (81 mg daily or 325 mg daily for ~3 
years) and/or folic acid (1 mg daily for ~6 years) for the prevention of
colorectal adenomas among 1121 participants with a previous adenoma. BCC was
confirmed by blinded review of pathology reports.
RESULTS: One hundred and four of 958 non-Hispanic white participants were
diagnosed with BCC over a median follow-up of 13·5 years. Cumulative incidence of
BCC was 12% [95% confidence interval (CI) 7-17] for placebo, 16% (95% CI 11-21)
for 81 mg aspirin daily and 15% (95% CI 10-20) for 325 mg aspirin daily [hazard
ratio (HR) for any aspirin 1·45 (95% CI 0·93-2·26); HR for 81 mg daily 1·57 (95% 
CI 0·96-2·56); HR for 325 mg daily 1·33 (95% CI 0·80-2·20)]. BCC risk was higher 
with aspirin use in those without previous skin cancer but lower with aspirin use
in those with previous skin cancer (Pinteraction = 0·02 for 81 mg aspirin daily; 
Pinteraction = 0·03 for 325 mg aspirin daily). Folic acid supplementation was
unrelated to BCC incidence (HR 0·85; 95% CI 0·57-1·27).
CONCLUSIONS: Neither aspirin nor folic acid treatment had a statistically
significant effect on risk of BCC. Subgroup analysis suggested that
chemopreventive effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be specific
to those at high risk for BCC.

PURPOSE: Regionalization of care and travel distance may result in unintended
consequences for complex surgery such as cystectomy. Our objective was to
evaluate effect of differential distance on cystectomy receipt among patients
with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and investigate the association
between travel distance and cystectomy outcomes such as readmission.
METHODS: Using a linked data resource combining the NC Central Cancer Registry
with claims data from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance plans, we
included 736 patients with MIBC and 1,082 who underwent cystectomy. To evaluate
access, differential distance was calculated as the difference between the
nearest urologist and nearest cystectomy provider. To assess outcomes, logistic
regression was used to evaluate rehospitalization and major complications, and
Cox proportional hazards model for survival analysis.
RESULTS: To evaluate access and outcomes, 736 patients with MIBC and 1,082
patients undergoing cystectomy were evaluated, respectively. Overall, 29% (211 of
736) with MIBC underwent cystectomy. Differential distance was not a predictor of
cystectomy receipt (odds ratio = 1.0; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.01). Among patients
undergoing cystectomy, travel distance from cystectomy provider was not a
significant predictor of 30- or 31 to 90day readmissions (odds ratio = 1.0; 95%
CI: 1.00, 1.00) although patients who lived further from their cystectomy
provider were more likely to be readmitted to a nonindex hospital (P<0.001) when 
controlling for other factors. Although travel distance did not have a
significant effect on overall survival, patients readmitted between 31 to 90days 
had worse overall survival (P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The additional distance needed to reach a cystectomy provider did
not predict receipt of surgery for MIBC. Furthermore, travel distance from
cystectomy provider was not a significant predictor for subsequent readmission
after cystectomy and did not affect overall survival.

Benign cystic epithelial inclusions with squamous, glandular, or Müllerian
phenotypes are known to occur in the axillary lymph nodes of patients with benign
and malignant breast disease. Careful evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin-stained
slides and correlation with the histologic findings in the ipsilateral breast are
paramount in evaluation of suspected benign inclusions. In this case of ductal
carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast in a 73-year-old woman, DCIS also involved
epithelial inclusions in an ipsilateral axillary lymph node. The recognition of
these benign epithelial elements, and awareness that they can be involved by
DCIS, is crucial to avoid the overdiagnosis of metastatic carcinoma.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more
than 20 susceptibility loci for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and Barrett's
esophagus (BE). However, variants in these loci account for a small fraction of
cases of EA and BE. Genetic factors might interact with environmental factors to 
affect risk of EA and BE. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that may modify the associations of body mass index (BMI), smoking, and
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with risks of EA and BE.
METHODS: We collected data on single BMI measurements, smoking status, and
symptoms of GERD from 2284 patients with EA, 3104 patients with BE, and 2182
healthy individuals (controls) participating in the Barrett's and Esophageal
Adenocarcinoma Consortium GWAS, the UK Barrett's Esophagus Gene Study, and the UK
Stomach and Oesophageal Cancer Study. We analyzed 993,501 SNPs in DNA samples of 
all study subjects. We used standard case-control logistic regression to test for
gene-environment interactions.
RESULTS: For EA, rs13429103 at chromosome 2p25.1, near the RNF144A-LOC339788
gene, showed a borderline significant interaction with smoking status (P =
2.18×10-7). Ever smoking was associated with an almost 12-fold increase in risk
of EA among individuals with rs13429103-AA genotype (odds ratio=11.82; 95% CI,
4.03-34.67). Three SNPs (rs12465911, rs2341926, rs13396805) at chromosome 2q23.3,
near the RND3-RBM43 gene, interacted with GERD symptoms (P = 1.70×10-7, P =
1.83×10-7, and P = 3.58×10-7, respectively) to affect risk of EA. For BE,
rs491603 at chromosome 1p34.3, near the EIF2C3 gene, and rs11631094 at chromosome
15q14, at the SLC12A6 gene, interacted with BMI (P = 4.44×10-7) and pack-years of
smoking history (P = 2.82×10-7), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The associations of BMI, smoking, and GERD symptoms with risks of EA 
and BE appear to vary with SNPs at chromosomes 1, 2, and 15. Validation of these 
suggestive interactions is warranted.

Purpose: We aimed to examine the effects of multivalent binding and biomimetic
cell rolling on the sensitivity and specificity of circulating tumor cell (CTC)
capture. We also investigated the clinical significance of CTCs and their kinetic
profiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.Experimental
Design: Patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoing
radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.
Peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, including
before radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, as
well as 4 to 12 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. CTC capture was
accomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (CapioCyte) functionalized with
aEpCAM, aHER-2, and aEGFR.Results: CapioCyte was able to detect CTCs in all 24
cancer patients enrolled. Multivalent binding via poly(amidoamine) dendrimers
further improved capture sensitivity. We also showed that cell rolling effect can
improve CTC capture specificity (% of captured cells that are CK+/CD45-/DAPI+) up
to 38%. Among the 18 patients with sequential CTC measurements, the median CTC
decreased from 113 CTCs/mL before radiotherapy to 32 CTCs/mL at completion of
radiotherapy (P = 0.001). CTCs declined throughout radiotherapy in patients with 
complete clinical and/or radiographic response, in contrast with an elevation in 
CTCs at mid or post-radiotherapy in the two patients with known pathologic
residual disease.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that multivalent binding and
cell rolling can improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC capture compared 
with multivalent binding alone, allowing reliable monitoring of CTC changes
during and after treatment. Clin Cancer Res; 24(11); 2539-47. ©2018 AACR.

Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) is one of the most common
malignancies worldwide, and nucleotide excision repair (NER) is involved in SCCHN
susceptibility. In this analysis of 349 newly diagnosed SCCHN patients and 295
cancer-free controls, we investigated whether expression levels of eight core NER
proteins were associated with risk of SCCHN. We quantified NER protein expression
levels in cultured peripheral lymphocytes using a reverse-phase protein
microarray. Compared with the controls, SCCHN patients had statistically
significantly lower expression levels of ERCC3 and XPA (P = 0.001 and 0.001,
respectively). After dividing the subjects by controls' median values of
expression levels, we found a dose-dependent association between an increased
risk of SCCHN and low expression levels of ERCC3 (adjusted OR, 1.75, and 95% CI: 
1.26-2.42; Ptrend  = 0.008) and XPA (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.35-2.60;
Ptrend  = 0.001). We also identified a significant multiplicative interaction
between smoking status and ERCC3 expression levels (P = 0.014). Finally, after
integrating demographic and clinical variables, we found that the addition of
ERCC3 and XPA expression levels to the model significantly improved the
sensitivity of the expanded model on SCCHN risk. In conclusion, reduced protein
expression levels of ERCC3 and XPA were associated with an increased risk of
SCCHN. However, these results need to be confirmed in additional large studies.

PURPOSE: The survival benefit from detecting additional breast cancers by
preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to be controversial.
METHODS: We followed a cohort of 4454 women diagnosed with non-metastatic breast 
cancer (stage I-III) from 2/2005-6/2010 in five registries of the breast cancer
surveillance consortium (BCSC). BCSC clinical and registry data were linked to
Medicare claims and enrollment data. We estimated the cumulative probability of
breast cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. We tested the association of
preoperative MRI with all-cause mortality using a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: 917 (20.6%) women underwent preoperative MRI. No significant difference 
in the cumulative probability of breast cancer-specific mortality was found. We
observed no significant difference in the hazard of all-cause mortality during
the follow-up period after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors
among women with MRI (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.72-1.12) compared to those without MRI.
CONCLUSION: Our findings of no breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality
benefit supplement prior results that indicate a lack of improvement in surgical 
outcomes associated with use of preoperative MRI. In combination with other
reports, the results of this analysis highlight the importance of exploring the
benefit of preoperative MRI in patient-reported outcomes such as women's decision
quality and confidence levels with decisions involving treatment choices.

BACKGROUND: The roles parents play in supporting their child during painful
cancer procedures have been studied as communication strategies versus a broader 
caring framework and from a cross-sectional versus longitudinal perspective.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the longitudinal change in parent communication behaviors 
over repeated cancer port start procedures experienced by their children.
METHODS: This study used a longitudinal design. Two trained raters coded 104
recorded videos of port starts from 43 children being treated for cancer. This
included 25 children with two video-recorded port starts and 18 children with
three (T1, T2, T3). The Parent Caring Response Scoring System derived from
Swanson's Caring Theory was used to code parent communication behaviors as caring
responses during their children's port starts. Three 3- to 5-minute slices
(pre-port start, during, and post-port start) were coded for each video. Mixed
modeling with generalized estimating equations and Friedman test were used to
analyze longitudinal change in parent behaviors.
RESULTS: Significant differences were found between T1 versus T3 in eye contact
(β = -1.05, p = .02), distance-close-enough-to-touch (β = -0.81, p = .03),
nonverbal comforting (β = -1.34, p = .04), and availability (β = -0.92, p =
.036), suggesting that more parents used communication behaviors at T3 compared
with T1. Parent burdensome or intrusive questions (e.g., Why do you cry? β =
-1.11, p = .03) and nonverbal comforting (β = -1.52, p = .047) increased from T2 
to T3. The median values of parent communication behaviors overall had no
significant changes from T1 to T3.
CONCLUSION: Parents adjusted to use more nonverbal caring behaviors as their
child experienced additional port starts. Experimental studies should be designed
to help parents use caring behaviors to better support their children during
cancer procedures.

The role of host epigenetic mechanisms in the natural history of low-grade
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1) is not well characterized. We explored 
differential methylation of imprinted gene regulatory regions as predictors of
the risk of CIN1 regression. A total of 164 patients with CIN1 were recruited
from 10 Duke University clinics for the CIN Cohort Study. Participants had
colposcopies at enrollment and up to five follow-up visits over 3 years. DNA was 
extracted from exfoliated cervical cells for methylation quantitation at CpG
(cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping.
Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox
regression to quantify the effect of methylation on CIN1 regression over two
consecutive visits, compared to non-regression (persistent CIN1; progression to
CIN2+; or CIN1 regression at a single time-point), adjusting for age, race,
high-risk HPV (hrHPV), parity, oral contraceptive and smoking status. Median
participant age was 26.6 years (range: 21.0-64.4 years), 39% were
African-American, and 11% were current smokers. Most participants were
hrHPV-positive at enrollment (80.5%). Over one-third of cases regressed (n = 53, 
35.1%). Median time-to-regression was 12.6 months (range: 4.5-24.0 months).
Probability of CIN1 regression was negatively correlated with methylation at
IGF2AS CpG 5 (HR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.23-0.77) and PEG10 DMR (HR = 0.80; 95%
CI = 0.65-0.98). Altered methylation of imprinted IGF2AS and PEG10 DMRs may play 
a role in the natural history of CIN1. If confirmed in larger studies, further
research on imprinted gene DMR methylation is warranted to determine its efficacy
as a biomarker for cervical cancer screening.

OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: This study compares the hospital cost of osseointegrated
implants for retention of an auricular prosthesis to autologous ear
reconstruction.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.
METHODS: This study includes patients who underwent reconstruction for either
congenital or acquired ear defects at Duke University Medical Center during 2009 
to 2015.
RESULTS: A total of nine patients had autologous repair representing nine
operative ears, and 16 patients had an osseointegrated implant representing 18
operative ears (two bilateral). The average age for the autologous repair was
11.6 years with 56% male versus 40.7 years with 56% male for the osseointegrated 
implant patients. For autologous patients, indications for surgery were
anotia/microtia in 8/9 (89%) and trauma in 1/9 (11%) versus 6/16 (387.5%)
anotia/microtia, 8/16 (50%) cancer, and 2/16 (132.5%) trauma in the
osseointegrated implant group. The mean number of surgeries was 3.1 for
autologous repairs and 1.0 for osseointegrated repairs (mean difference
confidence interval [CI]: -2.4 to -1.8, P < .001). The average cost to the
hospital for an osseointegrated repair was $6,491.39 versus $10,047.93 for
autologous repairs (CI: $6,496.38 to $-616.68, P = .02) CONCLUSIONS:
Osseointegrated implants for retaining an auricular prosthesis has a similar cost
to autologous repair of ear defects, but patients underwent an average of two
more surgeries with autologous repair. Patients should be able to choose the
reconstruction option that best suits their condition and preferences.

INTRODUCTION: Oral mucositis (OM) is a major dose-limiting side effect of
chemotherapy and radiation used in cancer treatment. Due to the complex nature of
OM, currently available drug-based treatments are of limited efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (i) to determine genes and molecular pathways
associated with OM and wound healing using computational tools and publicly
available data and (ii) to identify drugs formulated for topical use targeting
the relevant OM molecular pathways.
METHODS: OM and wound healing-associated genes were determined by text mining,
and the intersection of the two gene sets was selected for gene ontology analysis
using the GeneCodis program. Protein interaction network analysis was performed
using STRING-db. Enriched gene sets belonging to the identified pathways were
queried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates for
topical use in OM.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified 447 genes common to both the "OM" and "wound
healing" text mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis yielded 20 genes
representing six pathways and targetable by a total of 32 drugs which could
possibly be formulated for topical application. A manual search on
ClinicalTrials.gov confirmed no relevant pathway/drug candidate had been
overlooked. Twenty-five of the 32 drugs can directly affect the PTGS2 (COX-2)
pathway, the pathway that has been targeted in previous clinical trials with
limited success.
CONCLUSIONS: Drug discovery using in silico text mining and pathway analysis
tools can facilitate the identification of existing drugs that have the potential
of topical administration to improve OM treatment.

Four new homoisoflavonoids,
7-O-methyl-8-demethoxy-3'-hydroxy-3,9-dihydropunctatin (4),
6-hydroxy-8-demethoxy-4'-O-methyl-3,9-dihydropunctatin (8),
7,4'-O-dimethyl-8-demethoxy-3,3'-dihydroxy-3,9-dihydropunctatin (13), and
7-O-methyl-3-hyroxy-3,9-dihydropunctatin (14) were identified from a chloroform
extract of the bulbs of Bellevalia flexuosa, along with 13 known analogues. The
structures were determined by analysis of HRMS and NMR data, while ECD
spectroscopy enabled the assignment of the absolute configurations of the new
compounds 4, 8, 13 and 16. The cytotoxic activities of the isolated compounds
(1-17) were evaluated using a panel of human cancer cell lines. Compounds 2 and 7
were the most potent against the MDA-MB-435 (melanoma) cancer cell line with IC50
values of 1.6 and 2.0 μM, respectively, and were essentially equipotent against
the OVCAR3 (ovarian) cancer cell line with IC50 values of 9.5 and 10.8 μM,
respectively. However, compound 7, with an IC50 value of 3.6 μM, was the most
potent against the MDA-MB-231 (breast) cancer cell line.

PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship
between exercise and sleep disturbance in a sample of individuals diagnosed with 
stage I, II, and III colorectal cancer (CRC) as patients transitioned off
first-line treatment. We also sought to identify heterogeneity in the
relationship between sleep disturbance and exercise.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the MY-Health study, a community-based
observational study of adults diagnosed with cancer. Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System® (PROMIS) measures (e.g., PROMIS Sleep) were
administered, and participants self-reported demographics, comorbidities, cancer 
treatment, and exercise. Regression mixture and multiple regression models were
used to evaluate the relationship between sleep disturbance and exercise
cross-sectionally at an average of 10 months after diagnosis, and the change in
sleep disturbance over a 7-month period, from approximately 10 to 17 months
post-diagnosis.
RESULTS: Patients whose exercise was categorized as likely at or above American
College of Sports Medicine's guidelines did not report statistically better sleep
quality compared to patients who were classified as not active. However,
retirement (B = - 2.4), anxiety (B = 0.21), and fatigue (B = 0.24) had
statistically significant relationships with sleep disturbance (p < 0.05).
Increase in exercise was not significantly associated with a decrease in sleep
disturbance. No statistical heterogeneity was revealed in the relationship
between sleep and exercise.
CONCLUSIONS: Further prospective research using an objective measure of exercise 
is warranted to confirm or refute the nature of the relationship between exercise
and sleep disturbance in individuals diagnosed with CRC transitioning off
first-line treatment.

Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.

Until recently, palliative options for the treatment of platinum-refractory
recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) have
been cytotoxic chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors. These agents offer limited
efficacy with substantial toxicity. The development of novel immune checkpoint
inhibitors has challenged the standard treatment. Pembrolizumab is a potent and
highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction
between PD-1, an immune checkpoint receptor and its ligands PD-L1 and -2. In
August 2016, the US FDA approved the use of pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC following 
disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. This review
highlights the pharmacology, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability data relevant 
to the use of pembrolizumab for the treatment of R/M HNSCC. Readers will gain
greater insight into the HNSCC tumor microenvironment, available biomarkers, and 
learn about important clinical considerations associated with the use of
pembrolizumab and similar immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Delayed age-related lobular involution has been previously associated with
elevated breast cancer risk. However, intraindividual variability in epithelial
involution status within a woman is undefined. We developed a novel measure of
age-related epithelial involution, density of epithelial nuclei in epithelial
areas using digital image analysis in combination with stromal characteristics
(percentage of section area comprising stroma). Approximately 1800 hematoxylin
and eosin stained sections of benign breast tissue were evaluated from 416
participants having breast surgery for cancer or benign conditions. Two to
sixteen slides per woman from different regions of the breast were studied.
Epithelial involution status varied within a woman and as a function of stromal
area. Percentage stromal area varied between samples from the same woman (median 
difference between highest and lowest stromal area within a woman was 7.5%, but
ranged from 0.01 to 86.7%). Restricting to women with at least 10% stromal area
(N = 317), epithelial nuclear density decreased with age (-637.1 cells/mm2 per
decade of life after age 40, p < 0.0001), increased with mammographic density
(457.8 cells/mm2 per increasing BI-RADs density category p = 0.002), and
increased non-significantly with recent parity, later age at first pregnancy, and
longer and more recent oral contraceptive use. These associations were attenuated
in women with mostly fat samples (<10% stroma (N = 99)). Thirty-one percent of
women evaluated had both adequate stroma (≥10%) and mostly fat (<10% stroma)
regions of breast tissue, with the probability of having both types increasing
with the number breast tissue samplings. Several breast cancer risk factors are
associated with elevated age-related epithelial content, but associations depend 
upon stromal context. Stromal characteristics appear to modify relationships
between risk factor exposures and breast epithelial involution.

OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the relationship between having a first-degree 
relative (FDR) with colorectal cancer (CRC) and risk for metachronous colorectal 
adenoma (CRA) following polypectomy.
METHODS: We pooled data from seven prospective studies of 7697 patients with
previously resected CRAs to quantify the relationship between having a FDR with
CRC and risk for metachronous adenoma.
RESULTS: Compared with having no family history of CRC, a positive family history
in any FDR was significantly associated with increased odds of developing any
metachronous CRA (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.01-1.29). Higher odds of CRA were
observed among individuals with an affected mother (OR = 1.27; 95%
CI = 1.05-1.53) or sibling (OR = 1.34; 95% CI = 1.11-1.62) as compared with those
without, whereas no association was shown for individuals with an affected
father. Odds of having a metachronous CRA increased with number of affected FDRs,
with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.07 (0.93-1.23) for one relative and 1.39 (1.02-1.91) for 
two or more. Younger age of diagnosis of a sibling was associated with higher
odds of metachronous CRA, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.66 (1.08-2.56) for diagnosis at
<54 years; 1.34 (0.89-2.03) for 55-64 years; and 1.10 (0.70-1.72) for >65 years
(p-trend = 0.008). Although limited by sample size, results for advanced
metachronous CRA were similar to those for any metachronous CRA.
CONCLUSIONS: A family history of CRC is related to a modestly increased odds of
metachronous CRA. Future research should explore whether having a FDR with CRC,
particularly at a young age, should have a role in risk stratification for
surveillance colonoscopy.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance of patients with 
Barrett's esophagus (BE) to identify those with dysplasia (a precursor of
carcinoma) or early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) who can be treated
endoscopically. However, it is unclear whether surveillance increases survival
times of patients with BE. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
qualitatively and quantitatively examine evidence for the association of
endoscopic surveillance in patients with BE with survival and other outcomes.
METHODS: We searched publication databases for studies reporting the effects of
endoscopic surveillance on mortality and other EAC-related outcomes. We reviewed 
randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, studies comparing patients
with BE who received regular surveillance with those who did not receive regular 
surveillance, and studies comparing outcomes of patients with
surveillance-detected EAC vs symptom-detected EACs. We performed a meta-analysis 
of surveillance studies to generate summary estimates using a random effects
model. The primary aim was to examine the association of BE surveillance on
EAC-related mortality. Secondary aims were to examine the association of BE
surveillance with all-cause mortality and EAC stage at time of diagnosis.
RESULTS: A single case-control study did not show any association between
surveillance and EAC-related mortality. A meta-analysis of 4 cohort studies found
that lower EAC-related and all-cause mortality were associated with regular
surveillance (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.50-0.71; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.59-0.94). Meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies showed lower EAC-related and
all-cause mortality among patients with surveillance-detected EAC vs
symptom-detected EAC (relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94; hazard ratio, 0.59;
95% CI, 0.45-0.76). Lead- and length-time bias adjustment substantially
attenuated/eliminated the observed benefits. Surveillance was associated with
detection of EAC at earlier stages. A randomized trial is underway to evaluate
the effects of endoscopic surveillance on mortality in patients with BE.
CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of
surveillance in patients with BE, surveillance as currently performed was
associated with detection of earlier-stage EAC and may provide a small survival
benefit. However, the effects of confounding biases on these estimates are not
fully defined and may completely or partially explain the observed differences
between surveyed and unsurveyed patients.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, reliability and validity of reflection
spectroscopy (RS) to assess skin carotenoids in a racially diverse sample.
DESIGN: Study 1 was a cross-sectional study of corner store customers (n 479) who
completed the National Cancer Institute Fruit and Vegetable Screener as well as
RS measures. Feasibility was assessed by examining the time it took to complete
three RS measures, reliability was assessed by examining the variation between
three RS measures, and validity was examined by correlation with self-reported
fruit and vegetable consumption. In Study 2, validity was assessed in a smaller
sample (n 30) by examining associations between RS measures and dietary
carotenoids, fruits and vegetables as calculated from a validated FFQ and plasma 
carotenoids.
SETTING: Eastern North Carolina, USA.
RESULTS: It took on average 94·0 s to complete three RS readings per person. The 
average variation between three readings for each participant was 6·8 %. In Study
2, in models adjusted for age, race and sex, there were statistically significant
associations between RS measures and (i) FFQ-estimated carotenoid intake
(P<0·0001); (ii) FFQ-estimated fruit and vegetable consumption (P<0·010); and
(iii) plasma carotenoids (P<0·0001).
CONCLUSIONS: RS is a potentially improved method to approximate fruit and
vegetable consumption among diverse participants. RS is portable and easy to use 
in field-based public health nutrition settings. More research is needed to
investigate validity and sensitivity in diverse populations.

Although many of the 16,000 children in the United States diagnosed who are with 
cancer each year could benefit from pediatric palliative care, these services
remain underused. Evidence regarding the barriers impeding access to
comprehensive palliative care is dispersed in the literature, and evidence
specific to pediatric oncology remains particularly sparse. The purpose of the
current review was to synthesize the existing literature regarding these barriers
and the strategies offered to address them. The authors completed a literature
search using the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL), and Web of Science databases. In total, 71 articles were reviewed.
Barriers to accessing pediatric palliative care were categorized according to the
4 levels of a modified socioecological model (ie, barriers related to
policy/payment, health systems, organizations, and individuals). Major themes
identified at each level included: 1) the lack of consistent and adequate funding
mechanisms at the policy/payment level, 2) the lack of pediatric palliative care 
programs and workforce at the health systems level, 3) difficulties integrating
palliative care into existing pediatric oncology care models at the
organizational level, and 4) the lack of knowledge about pediatric palliative
care, discomfort with talking about death, and cultural differences between
providers and patients and their families at the individual level.
Recommendations to address each of the barriers identified in the literature are 
included. Cancer 2018;124:2278-88. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

OBJECTIVE: A geriatric assessment (GA) assesses functional age of older patients 
with cancer and is a well-established tool predictive of toxicity and survival.
The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of individual
GA items.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 546 patients with cancer ≥ 65 years completed GA from 2009
to 2014 and were followed for survival status for a median of 3.7 years. The GA
consisted of function, nutrition, comorbidity, cognition, psychological state,
and social activity/support domains. GA items with p < 0.05 in univariable
analyses for overall survival (OS) were entered into multivariable stepwise
selection procedure using a Cox proportional hazards model. A prognostic scale
was constructed with significant GA items retained in the final model.
RESULTS: Median age was 72 years, 49% had breast cancer, and 42% had stage 3-4
cancer. Three GA items were significant prognostic factors, independent of
traditional factors (cancer type, stage, age, and Karnofsky Performance Status): 
(1) "limitation in walking several blocks", (2) "limitation in shopping", and (3)
"≥ 5% unintentional weight loss in 6 months". A three-item prognostic scale was
constructed with these items. In comparison with score 0 (no positive items),
hazard ratios for OS were 1.85 for score 1, 2.97 for score 2, and 8.67 for score 
3. This translated to 2-year estimated survivals of 85%, 67%, 51% and 17% for
scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This three-item scale was a strong independent predictor of
survival. If externally validated, this could be a streamlined tool with broader 
applicability.

BACKGROUND: Oncolytic viruses are genetically engineered or naturally occurring
viruses that selectively replicate in cancer cells without harming normal cells. 
Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic®), the first oncolytic viral therapy approved
for treatment of cancer, was approved for treatment of locally advanced melanoma 
in October 2015.
PURPOSE: As a biologic product, use of T. laherparepvec in the clinical setting
requires pretreatment planning and a unique systematic approach to deliver the
therapy. The processes we describe herein could be adopted by other centers that 
choose to prescribe T. laherparepvec.
METHODS: We studied our clinical trial experience with T. laherparepvec before we
embarked on using commercially available T. laherparepvec. We created a standard 
operating procedure (SOP) with multidisciplinary buy-in and oversight from
leadership in Infection Control at our institution. We reflected on clinical
cases and the actual procedures of administering T. laherparepvec to create the
SOP.
RESULTS: The preimplementation planning, patient selection, identification of
lesions to treat, the actual procedure, and ongoing assessment of patients are
described. Tumoral-related factors that lead to unique challenges are described.
CONCLUSIONS: A process to ensure safe and responsible implementation of a program
to administer T. laherparepvec for treatment of melanoma may improve the quality 
of treatment for patients who suffer from advanced melanoma.

Summary: Copy number variation is an important and abundant source of variation
in the human genome, which has been associated with a number of diseases,
especially cancer. Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copy
number profiling with fine resolution. Such efforts, however, have met with mixed
successes, with setbacks arising partly from the lack of reliable analytical
methods to meet the diverse and unique challenges arising from the myriad
experimental designs and study goals in genetic studies. In cancer genomics,
detection of somatic copy number changes and profiling of allele-specific copy
number (ASCN) are complicated by experimental biases and artifacts as well as
normal cell contamination and cancer subclone admixture. Furthermore, careful
statistical modeling is warranted to reconstruct tumor phylogeny by both somatic 
ASCN changes and single nucleotide variants. Here we describe a flexible
computational pipeline, MARATHON, which integrates multiple related statistical
software for copy number profiling and downstream analyses in disease genetic
studies.

Although the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and its product H3K27me3 are well
studied in cancer, little is known about their role and potential as therapeutic 
targets in endometriosis. We have previously reported that endometriotic lesions 
are characterized by global enrichment of H3K27me3. Therefore, we aimed to (1)
characterize the expression levels of EZH2 in endometriotic tissues; (2) assess
H3K27me3 enrichment in candidate genes promoter regions; and (3) determine if
pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 impacts migration, proliferation, and invasion
of endometriotic cells. Immunohistochemistry of an endometriosis-focused tissue
microarray was used to assess the EZH2 protein levels in tissues. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation-qPCR was conducted to assess enrichment of H3K27me3 in
candidate gene promoter regions in tissues. Immunofluorescence was performed to
assess the effect of an EZH2-specific pharmacological inhibitor on H3K27me3
global enrichment in cell lines. To measure effects of the inhibitor in
migration, proliferation, and invasion in vitro we used Scratch, BrdU, and
Matrigel assays, respectively. Endometriotic lesions had significantly higher
EZH2α nuclear immunostaining levels compared to eutopic endometrium from patients
(glands, stroma) and controls (glands). H3K27me3 was enriched within promoter
regions of candidate genes in some but not all of the endometriotic lesions.
Inhibition of EZH2 reduced H3K27me3 levels in the endometriotic cells
specifically, and also reduced migration, proliferation but not invasion of
endometriotic epithelial cells (12Z). These findings support future preclinical
studies to determine in vivo efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors as promising nonhormonal
treatments for endometriosis, still an incurable gynecological disease.

Urological Survivorship Issues Among Adolescent Boys and Young Men Who Are Cancer
Survivors.

BACKGROUND: Urological survivorship issues encompass an area that may potentially
be overlooked after treatment of childhood cancer in adolescent boys and young
men. Side effects of cancer therapy may include subsequent development of
erectile dysfunction (ED), hypogonadism, and infertility in adulthood.
AIM: The purpose of this review is to focus on the etiology and prevalence of the
range of sexual and gonadal dysfunction in adolescent boys and young men who are 
cancer survivors, while discussing current recommendations for evaluation and
treatment.
METHODS: We performed a literature review of articles evaluating hypogonadism,
sexual dysfunction, ED, and infertility in young men cancer survivors.
OUTCOMES: There is compelling evidence that significant survivorship issues are
faced by boys entering adulthood after completing cancer therapy.
RESULTS: Overall, young men cancer survivors are much more likely to report
symptoms of sexual dysfunction than the general population of men. These patients
can develop ED due to physiologic and psychological changes that take place with 
diagnosis of a malignancy and subsequent treatment. Primary hypogonadism can
arise due to pelvic radiation or chemotherapy, and central hypogonadism may arise
from pituitary insufficiency after brain radiation or surgery. Infertility
develops from direct damage to the Sertoli cells and germinal epithelium from
radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Cancer survivors who are men should therefore be
screened for these important urological survivorship issues, although exact
surveillance strategies remain unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Urological survivorship issues including ED, hypogonadism, and
infertility are common among cancer survivors and result in significant
morbidity. Due to the medical complexity of cancer survivorship, the population
of adolescent and young adult survivors would benefit from a network of
multidisciplinary survivorship experts to aid the transition into adulthood.
Improved research efforts may help to clarify risk factors and to develop
enhanced strategies for evaluation and treatment. Sukhu T, Ross S, Coward RM.

Purpose: Infused autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and
tumor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells typically surround
malignant lesions or penetrate small tumor nodules but fail to penetrate large
solid tumors, significantly compromising their antitumor impact. Strategies to
overcome this primary challenge are largely required.Experimental Design: We
tested the effects of IL12 plus doxorubicin on T-cell penetration and efficacy in
solid tumors in a murine lung cancer model, a murine breast carcinoma lung
metastasis model, and two human xenograft tumor models bearing large tumors (>10 
mm).Results: Intriguingly, this simple approach increased the numbers, the
distribution, and the depth of penetration of infused CD8+ T cells in these
tumors, including both TILs and CAR T cells. This combined treatment halted tumor
progression and significantly extended survival time. Studies of the underlying
mechanism revealed multiple effects. First, the combined treatment maintained the
high ratios of immune-stimulatory receptors to immune-inhibitory receptors on
infiltrated CD8+ T cells, reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressive
regulatory T cells, and enhanced the numbers of T-bet+ effector T cells in the
tumors. Second, doxorubicin induced chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, which may
attract NKG2D+CD8+ T cells to tumors, and this effect was boosted by IL12-induced
IFNγ accumulation in tumors, promoting the penetration of NKG2D+CD8+ T
cells.Conclusions: The deep penetration of infused T cells associated with
combined IL12 plus doxorubicin yielded striking therapeutic effects in murine and
human xenograft solid tumors. This approach might broaden the application of
T-cell therapy to a wider range of solid tumors. Clin Cancer Res; 24(12);

OBJECTIVE: The USA is considering a very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarette
standard. We sought to characterise the prevalence and correlates of the
incorrect belief that VLNC cigarettes are less carcinogenic than current
cigarettes, as this could reduce motivation to quit.
METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 650 adult
smokers in the USA. In 2015-2016, before the VLNC proposal became public, these
smokers took part in an online survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses to 
calculate ORs and percentages and a χ2 test to examine the association between
variables.
RESULTS: Overall, 47.1% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for 30
years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. This 
misperception was more common among smokers who were aged above 55 (56.6%) and
black (57.4%). Additionally, 23.9% of smokers reported they would be less likely 
to quit if the USA adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes would
be less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be less
likely to quit (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking VLNC cigarettes is
less likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would be less likely to
quit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a communication
campaign that emphasises the continued dangers of smoking VLNC cigarettes due to 
the many toxic chemicals in smoke.

Background: Breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease
have a continuous long-term risk for fatal breast cancer, but the biological
factors influencing this risk are unknown. We aimed to determine whether high
intratumor heterogeneity of ER predicts an increased long-term risk (25 years) of
fatal breast cancer.
Methods: The STO-3 trial enrolled 1780 postmenopausal lymph node-negative breast 
cancer patients randomly assigned to receive adjuvant tamoxifen vs not. The
fraction of cancer cells for each ER intensity level was scored by breast cancer 
pathologists, and intratumor heterogeneity of ER was calculated using Rao's
quadratic entropy and categorized into high and low heterogeneity using a
predefined cutoff at the second tertile (67%). Long-term breast cancer-specific
survival analyses by intra-tumor heterogeneity of ER were performed using
Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling adjusting for
patient and tumor characteristics.
Results: A statistically significant difference in long-term survival by high vs 
low intratumor heterogeneity of ER was seen for all ER-positive patients (P <
.001) and for patients with luminal A subtype tumors (P = .01). In multivariable 
analyses, patients with high intratumor heterogeneity of ER had a twofold
increased long-term risk as compared with patients with low intratumor
heterogeneity (ER-positive: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.98, 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 1.31 to 3.00; luminal A subtype tumors: HR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.18 to 4.99).
Conclusions: Patients with high intratumor heterogeneity of ER had an increased
long-term risk of fatal breast cancer. Interestingly, a similar long-term risk
increase was seen in patients with luminal A subtype tumors. Our findings suggest
that intratumor heterogeneity of ER is an independent long-term prognosticator
with potential to change clinical management, especially for patients with
luminal A tumors.

BACKGROUND: Improvement in mortality has been shown for esophagectomies performed
at high-volume centers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if centralization of esophageal cancer
surgery occurred in the US, and to establish its impact on postoperative
mortality. In addition, we aimed to analyze the relationship between
regionalization of cancer care and health disparities.
METHODS: A retrospective population-based analysis was performed using the
National Inpatient Sample for the period 2000-2014. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of
age) diagnosed with esophageal cancer and who underwent esophagectomy were
included. Yearly hospital volume was categorized as low (< 5 procedures),
intermediate (5-20 procedures), and high (> 20 procedures). Multivariable
analyses on the potential effect of hospital volume on patient outcomes were
performed, and the yearly rate of esophagectomies was estimated using Poisson
regression.
RESULTS: A total of 5235 patients were included. Esophagectomy at low- [odds
ratio (OR) 2.17] and intermediate-volume (OR 1.62) hospitals, compared with
high-volume hospitals, was associated with a significant increase in mortality.
The percentage of esophagectomies performed at high-volume centers significantly 
increased during the study period (29.2-68.5%; p < 0.0001). The trend towards
high-volume hospitals was different among the different US regions: South
(7.7-54.3%), West (15.0-67.6%), Midwest (37.3-67.7%), and Northeast (55.8-86.8%) 
[p < 0.0001]. Overall, the mortality rate of esophagectomy dropped from 10.0 to
3.5% (p = 0.006), with non-White race, public insurance, and low household income
patients also showing a significant reduction in mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: A spontaneous centralization for esophageal cancer surgery occurred 
in the US. This process was associated with a decrease in the mortality rate,
without contributing to health disparities.

Background: While evidence is increasingly consistent with a positive association
between periodontitis and cancer risk, most studies have relied on self-reported 
periodontitis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the association of
periodontal disease severity with cancer risk in black and white older adults in 
a cohort study that included a dental examination.
Methods: Included were 7466 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities study cohort who at visit 4 (1996-1998) reported being edentulous or 
underwent the dental examination. Probing depth and gingival recession were
measured at six sites on all teeth; these measurements were used to define
periodontal disease severity. Incident cancers (n = 1648) and cancer deaths
(n = 547) were ascertained during a median of 14.7 years of follow-up. All
statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: An increased risk of total cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.44, Ptrend = .004) was observed for severe
periodontitis (>30% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm) compared with no/mild
periodontitis (<10% of sites with attachment loss >3 mm), adjusting for smoking
and other factors. Strong associations were observed for lung cancer (HR = 2.33, 
95% CI = 1.51 to 3.60, Ptrend < .001), and elevated risks were noted for
colorectal cancer for severe periodontitis, which were significant among never
smokers (HR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.00 to 4.47). Associations were generally weaker,
or not apparent among black participants, except for lung and colorectal cancers,
where associations were similar by race. No associations were observed for
breast, prostate, or hematopoietic and lymphatic cancer risk.
Conclusions: This study provides additional evidence that cancer risk, especially
for lung and colorectal cancer, is elevated in individuals with periodontitis.
Additional research is needed to understand cancer site-specific and racial
differences in findings.

BACKGROUND: Women at high lifetime breast cancer risk may benefit from
supplemental breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening, in addition to
routine mammography screening for earlier cancer detection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 422,406 women
undergoing routine mammography screening across 86 Breast Cancer Surveillance
Consortium (BCSC) facilities during calendar year 2012. We determined
availability and use of on-site screening breast MRI services based on
woman-level characteristics, including >20% lifetime absolute risk using the
National Cancer Institute risk assessment tool. Multivariate analyses were
performed to determine sociodemographic characteristics associated with on-site
screening MRI use.
RESULTS: Overall, 43.9% (2403/5468) of women at high lifetime risk attended a
facility with on-site breast MRI screening availability. However, only 6.6%
(158/2403) of high-risk women obtained breast MRI screening within a 2-year
window of their screening mammogram. Patient factors associated with on-site MRI 
screening use included younger (<40 years) age (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-4.21), family history (OR = 1.72, 95% CI:
1.13-2.63), prior breast biopsy (OR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.22-3.58), and postsecondary
education (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.04-4.74).
CONCLUSIONS: While nearly half of women at high lifetime breast cancer risk
undergo routine screening mammography at a facility with on-site breast MRI
availability, supplemental breast MRI remains widely underutilized among those
who may benefit from earlier cancer detection. Future studies should evaluate
whether other enabling factors such as formal risk assessment and patient
awareness of high lifetime breast cancer risk can mitigate the underutilization
of supplemental screening breast MRI.

BACKGROUND: Use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among
women with a new breast cancer has increased over the past decade. MRI use is
more frequent in younger women and those with lobular carcinoma, but associations
with breast density and family history of breast cancer are unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for 3075 women ages >65 years with stage 0-III breast
cancer who underwent breast conserving surgery or mastectomy from 2005 to 2010 in
the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium were linked to administrative claims
data to assess associations of preoperative MRI use with mammographic breast
density and first-degree family history of breast cancer. Multivariable logistic 
regression estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CI) for the association of MRI use with breast density and family history,
adjusting for woman and tumor characteristics.
RESULTS: Overall, preoperative MRI use was 16.4%. The proportion of women
receiving breast MRI was similar by breast density (17.6% dense, 16.9% nondense) 
and family history (17.1% with family history, 16.5% without family history).
After adjusting for potential confounders, we found no difference in preoperative
MRI use by breast density (OR = 0.95 for dense vs. nondense, 95% CI: 0.73-1.22)
or family history (OR = 0.99 for family history vs. none, 95% CI: 0.73-1.32).
CONCLUSIONS: Among women aged >65 years with breast cancer, having dense breasts 
or a first-degree relative with breast cancer was not associated with greater
preoperative MRI use. This utilization is in keeping with lack of evidence that
MRI has higher yield of malignancy in these subgroups.

PURPOSE: Seminomas are solid tumors in young men, but which rarely metastasize to
the orbit. The authors review the known literature on seminoma metastatic to the 
orbit, and describe an additional case in a 33-year-old man.
METHODS: A literature search was performed on the MEDLINE database using keywords
"seminoma," "testicular germ-cell tumors," "testicular cancer," "testicular
neoplasm," "orbital metastasis," and "germ-cell neoplasms."
RESULTS: Malignant neoplasms of the testis account for only 1% of cancers in men.
None-the-less, testicular germ cell seminoma is the most common solid tumor found
in young men between the ages of 15 and 39. Only seven previous cases have been
mentioned in the literature. The pathogenesis remains unclear although genetic,
environmental, and maternal factors may play a role. The number of cases is too
few to determine the best treatment options, but surgical excision and adjunctive
orbital radiotherapy appear to be most appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS: Although metastases to the orbit are rare, seminoma should be
considered in the differential diagnosis of all young men with proptosis.

A strong positive association has been observed between circulating
anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a biomarker of ovarian reserve, and breast cancer
risk in three prospective studies. Confirming this association is important
because of the paucity of biomarkers of breast cancer risk in premenopausal
women. We conducted a consortium study including ten prospective cohorts that had
collected blood from premenopausal women. A nested case-control design was
implemented within each cohort. A total of 2,835 invasive (80%) and in situ (20%)
breast cancer cases were individually matched to controls (n = 3,122) on age at
blood donation. AMH was measured using a high sensitivity enzyme-linked
immunoabsorbent assay. Conditional logistic regression was applied to the
aggregated dataset. There was a statistically significant trend of increasing
breast cancer risk with increasing AMH concentration (ptrend across quartiles
<0.0001) after adjusting for breast cancer risk factors. The odds ratio (OR) for 
breast cancer in the top vs. bottom quartile of AMH was 1.60 (95%
CI = 1.31-1.94). Though the test for interaction was not statistically
significant (pinteraction  = 0.15), the trend was statistically significant only 
for tumors positive for both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor
(PR): ER+/PR+: ORQ4-Q1  = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.46-2.64, ptrend <0.0001; ER+/PR-:
ORQ4-Q1  = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.40-1.68, ptrend  = 0.51; ER-/PR+: ORQ4-Q1  = 3.23,
95% CI = 0.48-21.9, ptrend  = 0.26; ER-/PR-: ORQ4-Q1  = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.63-2.09,
ptrend  = 0.60. The association was observed for both pre- (ORQ4-Q1 = 1.35, 95%
CI = 1.05-1.73) and post-menopausal (ORQ4-Q1  = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03-2.53) breast 
cancer (pinteraction  = 0.34). In this large consortium study, we confirmed that 
AMH is associated with breast cancer risk, with a 60% increase in risk for women 
in the top vs. bottom quartile of AMH.

Cancer has been shown to negatively stimulate autophagy, leading to a decline in 
cardiac function. Although exercise is cardioprotective, its influence over
autophagy-mediated tumor growth and cardiac function are not well
defined.PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise on tumor
morphology and cardiac function.
METHODS: Fisher 344 rats (n = 28) were assigned to one of four groups: 1)
sedentary non-tumor bearing (SED), 2) sedentary tumor bearing (SED + T), 3) wheel
run non-tumor bearing (WR), or 4) wheel run tumor bearing (WR + T). Rats remained
sedentary or exercised for 6 wk. At week 4, rats in tumor groups were inoculated 
with MatBIII tumor cells. At week 6, cardiac function was measured.
RESULTS: SED + T animals exhibited significantly lower left ventricular developed
pressure when compared with SED, WR, and WR + T (P < 0.05). This coincided with a
significant increase in cardiac autophagy (increased LC3-II) in SED + T animals
when compared with SED, WR, and WR + T (P < 0.05). Furthermore, SED + T hearts
showed a significant increase in β-myosin heavy chain expression versus nontumor 
groups (P < 0.05). Tumor mass was significantly larger (P < 0.001) in SED + T
animals when compared with WR + T animals, which was accompanied by a significant
increase in tumor LC3-II protein expression (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Nonexercised tumor-bearing rats showed severe cardiac dysfunction and
excessive, maladaptive autophagy in the heart and tumors. Voluntary exercise
preserved cardiac function and attenuated the autophagic response in heart and
tumor tissues. This preservation may be related to the reduced tumor growth in
aerobically exercised rats, to the improved regulation of autophagy by exercise, 
or both.

BACKGROUND: Despite the psychological benefits and oncologic safety of
postmastectomy breast reconstruction, most breast cancer patients do not undergo 
reconstruction. To better understand the patterns of breast reconstruction usage,
it is important to identify the clinicopathologic factors associated with
immediate breast reconstruction (IBR), and whether modification of the
reconstruction incidence when stratified by patient- or cancer-related factors
exists in the breast cancer population. The primary objectives were to determine 
whether the incidence of immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction varies
across age, and whether the tumor grade or radiation therapy modify the effect of
age on the incidence of immediate breast reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
database, we identified women who had undergone mastectomy for breast cancer from
2000 to 2014. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted log-binomial regression
was used to estimate the effect of age on IBR after accounting for potential
confounding by patient demographic data and cancer characteristics. Potential
effect measure modification by tumor grade and radiation therapy on the age-IBR
relationship was also assessed.
RESULTS: Of 321,206 women, 77,798 (24.2%) had undergone IBR. Age was
significantly associated with IBR prevalence (P < .0001), with younger women more
likely to undergo IBR. Both tumor grade (P < .0001) and radiation therapy (P <
.0001) modified the effect of age on IBR.
CONCLUSION: Compared with their older counterparts, younger breast cancer
patients were more likely to undergo IBR, and both tumor grade and radiation
therapy were differentially associated with the likelihood of IBR across patient 
age.

PURPOSE: The incidence of localized prostate cancer has decreased with shifts in 
prostate cancer screening. While recent population based studies demonstrated a
stable incidence of locoregional prostate cancer, they categorized organ
confined, extraprostatic and lymph node positive disease together. However, to
our knowledge the contemporary incidence of prostate cancer with pelvic lymph
node metastases remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results) 
data from 2004 to 2014 to identify men diagnosed with prostate cancer. We
analyzed trends in the age standardized prostate cancer incidence by stage. The
impact of disease extent on mortality was assessed by adjusted Cox proportional
hazard analysis.
RESULTS: During the study period the annual incidence of nonmetastatic prostate
cancer decreased from 5,119.1 to 2,931.9 per million men (IR 0.57, 95% CI
0.56-0.58, p <0.01) while the incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases increased
from 54.1 to 79.5 per million men (IR 1.47, 95% CI 1.33-1.62, p <0.01). The
incidence of distant metastases in men 75 years old or older reached a nadir in
2011 compared to 2004 (IR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90, p <0.01) and it increased in
2012 compared to 2011 (IR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.24, p <0.05). The risk of cancer
specific mortality significantly increased in men diagnosed with pelvic lymph
node metastases (HR 4.5, 95% CI 4.2-4.9, p <0.01) and distant metastases (HR
21.9, 95% CI 21.2-22.7, p <0.01) compared to men with nonmetastatic disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pelvic lymph node metastases is increasing
coincident with a decline in the detection of localized disease. Whether this
portends an increase in the burden of advanced disease or simply reflects
decreased lead time remains unclear. However, this should be monitored closely as
the increase in N1 disease reflects an increase in incurable prostate cancer at
diagnosis.

This study evaluated the associations among perceived risk, perceived efficacy,
and engagement in six cancer-related risk behaviors in a population-based
Hispanic/Latino sample. Interviews were conducted with 5,313 Hispanic/Latino
adults as part of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)
Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Participants were recruited from the study's four 
field centers (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; San Diego, CA) between February
2010 and June 2011. Perceived risk and perceived efficacy were assessed with
questions drawn from the Health Interview National Trends Survey. More than half 
of the sample endorsed perceived risk of cancer associated with the six evaluated
behaviors, as well as general perceived efficacy for preventing cancer. Adjusted 
logistic regression analyses demonstrated significant differences across
Hispanic/Latino background groups for perceived risk associated with high
consumption of alcohol and saturated fat, low consumption of fruits and
vegetables, and insufficient exercise but not with smoking or low consumption of 
fiber. Differences were also found for the belief, "It seems like everything
causes cancer" but not for other perceived efficacy items. Perceived cancer risk 
and perceived efficacy for preventing cancer were neither independently nor
interactively associated with engagement in cancer-related risk behaviors after
controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Results suggest that perceptions of 
risk and efficacy with regard to cancer vary across Hispanic/Latino background
groups, and therefore background group differences should be considered in
prevention efforts. Perceived risk and perceived efficacy were not related to
cancer-related risk behaviors among Hispanics/Latinos. Further work is needed to 
evaluate determinants of cancer-related risk in this population.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence for a serum cholesterol-prostate cancer link
is mixed. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is positively correlated with
cholesterol, potentially increasing PSA-driven biopsy recommendations in men with
high cholesterol, though biopsy compliance may be lower in men with comorbid
conditions. These potential biases may affect PSA-driven biopsy rates and
subsequent prostate cancer detection in men with high serum cholesterol. Our
objective was to test the association between serum cholesterol and prostate
cancer risk in men receiving PSA independent, study-mandated prostate biopsies.
METHODS: We conducted a post hoc analysis of data from 4974 non-statin users in
REDUCE, a randomized trial in men with elevated PSA and a negative baseline
biopsy. Men underwent 2- and 4-year trial-mandated prostate biopsies.
Associations between baseline serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and prostate cancer risk,
overall and by Gleason grade (<7 vs. ≥7), were examined using multivariable
logistic regression.
RESULTS: High total serum cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of
high-grade prostate cancer diagnosis (OR per 10 mg/dL 1.05; 95% CI 1.00-1.09;
p = 0.048), but cholesterol was unrelated to either overall or low-grade prostate
cancer risk (p-values >0.185). There was no association between serum LDL and
overall, low- or high-grade prostate cancer risk (p-values >0.137). In contrast, 
elevated serum HDL was associated with increased risk of both overall (OR per
10 mg/dL 1.08; 95% CI 1.01-1.16; p = 0.033) and high-grade prostate cancer (OR
per 10 mg/dL 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.28; p = 0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: In REDUCE, where all men received PSA independent, trial-mandated
biopsies thus ensuring complete prostate cancer ascertainment, high total serum
cholesterol and high HDL were associated with increased risk of high-grade
prostate cancer, supporting a cholesterol-prostate cancer link.

BACKGROUND: It may seem questionable if antireflux surgery still has a role in
the management of patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) in the current era when 
antireflux surgery is facing a steady decline, obesity is increasing,
pharmacologic treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is in its
splendor, and endoscopic techniques are used more frequently. It is questionable 
if patients with BE should be operated to stop GERD and to prevent cancer. The
aim of this study was to determine the role of antireflux surgery in patients
with BE.
METHODS: Literature review.
RESULTS: The role of antireflux operations is, in fact, very controversial and
neglected. BE is a different phenotype of GERD with a distinct pathophysiology
linked to severe reflux of bile and acid, due to a marked anatomic disruption of 
the gastroesophageal barrier. Published series show that a fundoplication
adequately controls GERD and symptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or even
better a bile diversion antireflux procedure) may prevent esophageal
adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a fundoplication efficiently controls GERD and
symptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or even better a bile diversion
procedure) may also prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma.

KRAS: The Critical Driver and Therapeutic Target for Pancreatic Cancer.

Waters AM(1), Der CJ(1).

Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599.

RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) comprise the most frequently mutated oncogene
family in human cancer. With the highest RAS mutation frequencies seen with the
top three causes of cancer deaths in the United States (lung, colorectal, and
pancreatic cancer), the development of anti-RAS therapies is a major priority for
cancer research. Despite more than three decades of intense effort, no effective 
RAS inhibitors have yet to reach the cancer patient. With bitter lessons learned 
from past failures and with new ideas and strategies, there is renewed hope that 
undruggable RAS may finally be conquered. With the KRAS isoform mutated in 84% of
all RAS-mutant cancers, we focus on KRAS. With a near 100% KRAS mutation
frequency, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered the most
RAS-addicted of all cancers. We review the role of KRAS as a driver and
therapeutic target in PDAC.

Quantifying Cancer Risk from Radiation.

Keil AP(1), Richardson DB(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Chapel
Hill, NC, USA.

Complex statistical models fitted to data from studies of atomic bomb survivors
are used to estimate the human health effects of ionizing radiation exposures. We
describe and illustrate an approach to estimate population risks from ionizing
radiation exposure that relaxes many assumptions about radiation-related
mortality. The approach draws on developments in methods for causal inference.
The results offer a different way to quantify radiation's effects and show that
conventional estimates of the population burden of excess cancer at high
radiation doses are driven strongly by projecting outside the range of current
data. Summary results obtained using the proposed approach are similar in
magnitude to those obtained using conventional methods, although estimates of
radiation-related excess cancers differ for many age, sex, and dose groups. At
low doses relevant to typical exposures, the strength of evidence in data is
surprisingly weak. Statements regarding human health effects at low doses rely
strongly on the use of modeling assumptions.

Despite access to a growing menu of evidence-based interventions, public health
practitioners continue to underuse them, in part because practitioners may
require new knowledge, skills, and resources to do so. Numerous foundations,
universities, governmental agencies, and consultants are providing trainings to
address the gaps in practitioners' capacity. To most significantly affect
population health, these trainings need to reach practitioners who may have
limited access to on-site trainings. Despite the number of organizations offering
trainings, little is known about how to scale up trainings to efficiently extend 
their reach or how to tailor trainings to the needs of different intervention.
The Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network and its collaborating centers 
have developed a training curriculum and delivered it in both in-person and
distance formats to a range of audiences. The purpose of this article is to
describe the training curriculum and findings from the Network's evaluation of
approaches used to scale up delivery of the "Putting Public Health Evidence in
Action" curriculum and tailor content for specific evidence-based interventions.

BACKGROUND: Buparlisib is an oral pan-class I phosphotidyinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)
inhibitor. The present phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
efficacy of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast
cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received buparlisib once daily (range, 50 to 100
mg) for 3 weeks with capecitabine twice daily (range, 1000 to 1250 mg/m2) for 2
weeks with a 1-week break. Dose escalation used a traditional "3 + 3" design with
standard definitions of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose.
RESULTS: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 23 were evaluable for DLT and 17 were
evaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination was
buparlisib 100 mg daily and capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily. DLTs included
grade 3 hyperglycemia and grade 3 confusion. The most common grade 3 toxicities
were diarrhea and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
transaminase. One patient exhibited a complete response to treatment and four had
a confirmed partial response. In cohorts 3 and 4, in which the buparlisib dose
remained constant but the capecitabine dose was increased, significant increases 
in the buparlisib plasma concentration were noted.
CONCLUSION: The combination of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients with
metastatic breast cancer was generally well-tolerated, with several patients
demonstrating prolonged responses. Unexpectedly low rates of PIK3CA mutations (3 
of 17) were seen, and only 2 of 7 tumors with subtyping were luminal, making
exploration of these putative predictive markers impossible. Further study of the
combination is not unreasonable, with expanded pharmacokinetics and sequencing
analysis to better elucidate potential drug-drug interactions and more accurate
predictive biomarkers of response.

PURPOSE: As massively parallel sequencing is increasingly being used for clinical
decision making, it has become critical to understand parameters that affect
sequencing quality and to establish methods for measuring and reporting clinical 
sequencing standards. In this report, we propose a definition for reduced
coverage regions and describe a set of standards for variant calling in clinical 
sequencing applications.
METHODS: To enable sequencing centers to assess the regions of poor sequencing
quality in their own data, we optimized and used a tool (ExCID) to identify
reduced coverage loci within genes or regions of particular interest. We used
this framework to examine sequencing data from 500 patients generated in 10
projects at sequencing centers in the National Human Genome Research
Institute/National Cancer Institute Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research
Consortium.
RESULTS: This approach identified reduced coverage regions in clinically relevant
genes, including known clinically relevant loci that were uniquely missed at
individual centers, in multiple centers, and in all centers.
CONCLUSION: This report provides a process road map for clinical sequencing
centers looking to perform similar analyses on their data.

Importance: Oral anticancer medications are increasingly important but costly
treatment options for patients with cancer. By early 2017, 43 states and
Washington, DC, had passed laws to ensure patients with private insurance
enrolled in fully insured health plans pay no more for anticancer medications
administered by mouth than anticancer medications administered by infusion.
Federal legislation regarding this issue is currently pending. Despite their
rapid acceptance, the changes associated with state adoption of oral chemotherapy
parity laws have not been described.
Objective: To estimate changes in oral anticancer medication use, out-of-pocket
spending, and health plan spending associated with oral chemotherapy parity law
adoption.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis of administrative health plan claims 
data from 2008-2012 for 3 large nationwide insurers aggregated by the Health Care
Cost Institute. Data analysis was first completed in 2015 and updated in 2017.
The study population included 63 780 adults living in 1 of 16 states that passed 
parity laws during the study period and who received anticancer drug treatment
for which orally administered treatment options were available. Study analysis
used a difference-in-differences approach.
Exposures: Time period before and after adoption of state parity laws,
controlling for whether the patient was enrolled in a plan subject to parity
(fully insured) or not (self-funded, exempt via the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Oral anticancer medication use, out-of-pocket
spending, and total health care spending.
Results: Of the 63 780 adults aged 18 through 64 years, 51.4% participated in
fully insured plans and 48.6% in self-funded plans (57.2% were women; 76.8% were 
aged 45 to 64 years). The use of oral anticancer medication treatment as a
proportion of all anticancer treatment increased from 18% to 22% (adjusted
difference-in-differences risk ratio [aDDRR], 1.04; 95% CI, 0.96-1.13; P = .34)
comparing months before vs after parity. In plans subject to parity laws, the
proportion of prescription fills for orally administered therapy without
copayment increased from 15.0% to 53.0%, more than double the increase
(12.3%-18.0%) in plans not subject to parity (P < .001). The proportion of
patients with out-of-pocket spending of more than $100 per month increased from
8.4% to 11.1% compared with a slight decline from 12.0% to 11.7% in plans not
subject to parity (P = .004). In plans subject to parity laws, estimated monthly 
out-of-pocket spending decreased by $19.44 at the 25th percentile, by $32.13 at
the 50th percentile, and by $10.83 at the 75th percentile but increased at the
90th ($37.19) and 95th ($143.25) percentiles after parity (all P < .001,
controlling for changes in plans not subject to parity). Parity laws did not
increase 6-month total spending for users of any anticancer therapy or for users 
of oral anticancer therapy alone.
Conclusions and Relevance: While oral chemotherapy parity laws modestly improved 
financial protection for many patients without increasing total health care
spending, these laws alone may be insufficient to ensure that patients are
protected from high out-of-pocket medication costs.

Social media may provide new opportunities to promote skin cancer prevention, but
research to understand this potential is needed. In April of 2015, Kentucky
native Tawny Willoughby (TW) shared a graphic skin cancer selfie on Facebook that
subsequently went viral. We examined the volume of comments and shares of her
original Facebook post; news volume of skin cancer from Google News; and search
volume for skin cancer Google queries. We compared these latter metrics after TWs
announcement against expected volumes based on forecasts of historical trends.
TWs skin cancer story was picked up by the media on May 11, 2015 after the social
media post had been shared approximately 50,000 times. All search queries for
skin cancer increased 162% (95% CI 102 to 320) and 155% (95% CI 107 to 353) on
May 13th and 14th, when news about TW's skin cancer selfie was at its peak, and
remained higher through May 17th. Google searches about skin cancer prevention
and tanning were also significantly higher than expected volumes. In practical
terms, searches reached near-record levels - i.e., May 13th, 14th and 15th were
respectively the 6th, 8th, and 40th most searched days for skin cancer since
January 1, 2004 when Google began tracking searches. We conclude that an ordinary
person's social media post caught the public's imagination and led to significant
increases in public engagement with skin cancer prevention. Digital surveillance 
methods can rapidly detect these events in near real time, allowing public health
practitioners to engage and potentially elevate positive effects.

1. Red blood cell (RBC) partitioning is important in determining pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic properties of a compound; however, active transport across
RBC membranes is not well understood, particularly without transporter-related
cell membrane proteomics data. 2. In this study, we quantified breast cancer
resistance protein (BCRP/Bcrp) and MDR1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein expression 
in RBCs from humans, monkeys, dogs, rats and mice using nanoLC/MS/MS, and
evaluated their effect on RBC partitioning and plasma exposure of their
substrates. BCRP-specific substrate Cpd-1 and MDR1-specific substrate Cpd-2 were 
characterized using Caco-2 Transwell® system and then administered to Bcrp or
P-gp knockout mice. 3. The quantification revealed BCRP/Bcrp but not MDR1/P-gp to
be highly expressed on RBC membranes. The knockout mouse study indicated
BCRP/Bcrp pumps the substrate out of RBCs, lowering its partitioning and thus
preventing binding to intracellular targets. This result was supported by a Cpd-1
and Bcrp inhibitor ML753286 drug-drug interaction (DDI) study in mice. Because of
enhanced partitioning of Cpd-1 into RBCs after BCRP/Bcrp inhibition, Cpd-1 plasma
concentration changed much less extent with genetic or chemical knockout of Bcrp 
albeit marked blood concentration increase, suggesting less DDI effect. 4. This
finding is fundamentally meaningful to RBC partitioning, pharmacokinetics and DDI
studies of BCRP-specific substrates.

Introduction The rising cost of cancer drugs may make treatment unaffordable for 
some patients. Patients often rely on drug manufacturer-administered
Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) to obtain drugs and reduced or no cost.
The overall usage of PAPs within cancer care delivery is unknown. Methods We
included all cancer patients across an academically affiliated, integrated health
system in North Carolina during 2014 ( N = 8591). We identified the subset of
patients receiving PAP assistance to afford one or more cancer drugs, in order to
calculate the proportion of patients receiving PAP assistance, and the retail
value of the assistance. Results Among 8591 cancer patients, 215 unique patients 
submitted a total of 478 successful PAP requests for cancer drugs. 40% of
PAP-utilizing patients were uninsured, 23% had Medicaid coverage, 20% had
Medicare coverage, 2% were dual Medicare/Medicaid eligible, and 14% were
commercially insured. Among all cancer patients who received medical treatment,
6.0% required PAP assistance, whereas 10.6% receiving an oral agent required PAP 
assistance. The proportion receiving PAP assistance varied substantially by drug,
ranging from <1% of patients (e.g. carboplatin, methotrexate) to 50% of patients 
(e.g. ponatinib, temsirolimus). The majority of the retail value obtained was for
oral agents, including $1,556,575 of imatinib and $1,449,633 of dasatinib, which 
were the two drugs with the highest aggregate retail value. Conclusions A
substantial proportion of cancer patients receive private charitable assistance
to obtain standard-of-care treatments. This includes patients with federal and
private insurance, suggesting an inability of patients to meet cost-sharing
requirements.

The purpose of this study was to compare fatigue, strength, body composition,
muscle thickness, and muscle quality between Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors (HLS)
and apparently healthy subjects matched by age, gender, and physical activity
levels (CON). Twelve HLS (32.16 ± 8.06) and 36 CON (32.42 ± 7.64) were enrolled
in the study. Fatigue was assessed using the 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue
Inventory, muscle strength using an isokinetic dynamometer, body composition
using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and thickness and muscle quality using
B-mode ultrasound. Differences between HLS and CON were analyzed using
independent samples t tests. No significant differences were observed between
groups for any demographic characteristics: age ( P = .922), weight ( P = .943), 
height ( P = .511), body mass index ( P = .796), fat mass ( P = .688), fat-free
mass ( P = .520), and percent body fat ( P = .446). No significant differences
were observed for strength (peak torque; P = .552), relative peak torque ( P =
.200), muscle thickness ( P > .05) and muscle quality ( P > .05). However,
self-perceived fatigue was significantly higher in HLS than in CON ( P = .009).
It appears that when HLS are matched by age and physical activity levels to CON, 
no significant difference in body composition, muscle thickness, muscle quality, 
or strength is observed. Self-perceived fatigue, as predicted, is higher in HLS, 
which may have implications and should be considered when prescribing exercise
training to this cancer population.

Introduction: Cigarette smoke contains at least 93 chemicals or "constituents"
that the Food and Drug Administration has identified as harmful and potentially
harmful constituents to human health. Our study sought to identify which
constituent disclosure message elements are most effective in discouraging people
from smoking.
Methods: Three hundred eighty eight current smokers aged 18 and older completed
an online survey in February 2015. We randomized participants to respond to one
of two sets of 13 toxic products that contain cigarette constituents and 25
health effects associated with cigarette constituents.
Results: Products that elicited the most discouragement were those with lower
chances of exposure (e.g., explosives), followed by products with possible
exposure (e.g., rat poison), and products with a high likelihood of exposure
(e.g., floor cleaner). Awareness of toxic products that constituents are found in
(p < .001) and low exposure products (p < .001) were associated with higher
discouragement. Health effects that people had heard are caused by cigarette
smoke constituents elicited higher discouragement from smoking cigarettes (p <
.001). Cancer was associated with higher discouragement relative to respiratory, 
cardiovascular, and reproductive health effects (all p < .001).
Conclusions: Cigarette smoke constituent messages may be more effective at
discouraging smoking if they include information about carcinogenic health
effects (e.g., mouth cancer and lung tumors) and low exposure toxic products
(e.g., explosives and radioactive material) as message elements.
Implications: Our study identified health effects and toxic products, especially 
cancers and rarely encountered toxic products, that may discourage smoking when
included in disclosure messages. By constructing messages that communicate the
harms associated with tobacco use by contextualizing those harms in terms of
specific constituents, tobacco education messaging efforts may be increasingly
successful.

As the use of oral chemotherapy continues to rise, the issue of patient adherence
is a concerning aspect of cancer treatment. In this concurrent prospective and
retrospective study, we assessed oral chemotherapy adherence in patients
receiving their prescriptions at an institutional specialty pharmacy, with an
integrated oral chemotherapy program. The primary endpoint is medication
possession ratio. Secondary endpoints include self-reported adherence comparing
survey data before and after the introduction of the oral chemotherapy program to
assess the impact of the comprehensive pharmacy services provided. Patients
receiving their oral chemotherapy from the institutional specialty pharmacy have 
a mean medication possession ratio of 0.92, indicating excellent adherence rates.
The oncology clinical pharmacist, in collaboration with the specialty pharmacy,
has also decreased the rates of patient-reported non-adherence.

Filling GAPs in our knowledge: ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1 act as oncogenes in

Like RAS proteins, the aberrant function of RHO family small GTPases has been
implicated in driving cancer development and growth. However, unlike the RAS
family, where gain-of-function missense mutations are found in ∼25% of all human 
cancers, missense mutations are relatively rare in RHO proteins. Instead, altered
RHO activity in cancer more commonly arises through the aberrant functions of RHO
GTPase regulators. In many cancer types, altered expression and/or mutation of
RHO-selective guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RHOGEFs) or GTPase-activating 
proteins (RHOGAPs), which activate or inactivate RHO GTPases, respectively, is
observed. For example, deletion or loss of expression of the RHOA GAP DLC1 is
well-established to drive cancer growth. Recently, we identified high expression 
of 2 RHOGAPs, ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1, in the basal-like breast cancer subtype.
Unexpectedly, both of these RHOA GAPs exhibited properties of oncoproteins rather
than tumor suppressors, in contrast to DLC1. In this commentary, we summarize our
findings and speculate that different RHOA GAPs can play distinct roles in cancer
depending on their spatial regulation and cancer type context. We also evaluate
our results in light of recently-described cancer genome sequencing studies that 
have identified loss-of-function mutations of RHOA in specific cancer types.
